#	Suggestions for IEEE and ACM Members to Create Research Funding for Women

Dear Women Engineers, Researchers, and Professors, I would encourage you to simultaneously do the following.

Start a petition to IEEE Foundation for funding Ph.D. fellowships and postdoctoral fellowships for women, and for funding research projects of women junior faculty members.

At the same time, align your research with one of IEEE's Future Directions, or create a new initiative for a new IEEE Future Direction. See https://cmte.ieee.org/futuredirections/fd-opportunities/ for funding opportunities.

Since IEEE is listed as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, donations by individuals (including people living in the U.S. on temporary employment/student visas and undocumented immigrants) and organizations (including U.S. offices of companies headquartered outside the U.S.) in the United States to IEEE are tax-exempt. See https://www.ieee.org/about/financials.html.

So, if you can rally individuals and organizations to make donations to IEEE Foundation, you can convince senior executives at IEEE (they earn a lot) to take a pay cut and donate personally to the research fund. Also, they (on the behalf of IEEE as an organization) can provide a 1-to-1 match for donations to the research fund.

If you are willing to do the paperwork, and make the initial contacts with well-known professors, engineers, executives at engineering and high-tech companies, and researchers to create a new initiative for a new IEEE Future Direction, you can realize this sooner than later.

Even though, I am not funded for my Ph.D. studies/research, I am willing to sacrifice meals to donate to this cause. You just need to do the paperwork, so that donors like me can specify that we want our donations to go directly to IEEE Foundation for funding Ph.D. fellowships and postdoctoral fellowships for women, and for funding research projects of women junior faculty members.

You can collaborate with [Project Include](https://projectinclude.org/) to determine if men-led initiatives get reviewed and funded more oten than those led by women. Similarly, you can determine if the turn-over time for women-led initiatives are significant shorter, if not considerably shorter for men-led initiatives. Hence, it allows you and others to take a data science approach to gender equity at IEEE (and ACM, and similar organizations). 

Lastly, not only can you get similar organizations (such as ACM) to do likewise, but also jointly offer Ph.D. fellowships and postdoctoral fellowships for women, and funding for research projects of women junior faculty members.
