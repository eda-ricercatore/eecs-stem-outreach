#	Suggestions for Writing Research Proposals to Get Funding


	I have been auditing a course/class on writing award-winning U.S. NSF (the U.S. National Science Foundation) proposals.

	If you want to be a tenure-track assistant professor (especially in U.S. research universities) after getting your Ph.D., the following can be helpful for you.

	Firstly, he (the course instructor) asks us to comply with the "Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide" (PAPPG) from NSF. See https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg18_1/index.jsp and https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg. Not abiding by NSF requirements can cause proposals to be rejected without review.

	Secondly, regarding tenure-track assistant professors in U.S. research universities, he stressed the importance of writing research proposals to NSF instead of other agencies for funding. His argument is that other agencies/organizations (and companies) prefer to fund professors/researchers who are more famous, such as full professors at elite research universities. Also, getting a NSF CAREER award is typically considered as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for getting tenure at a sufficiently good U.S. research university. Tenure (and promotion) evaluation committees care about how much research funding you can bring to the university.

	NSF cares a lot about transformative research. See the postscript for references about transformative research and doing research in the Pasteur's Quadrant (or, use-inspired basic research) \cite{Randall2007,Mertens2009,Stokes1997}. Consequently, he regularly stresses the definition and importance of intellectual merit (IM) and broader impacts (BI), especially the difference between IM and BI. In addition, he stresses that activities to broaden participation of women and people from underrepresented groups are not so suitable for the BI section of NSF proposals. Broader impacts should stress how the new knowledge discovered by the research project would benefit society. An example of a broader impact is the advances in bio design automation and synthetic biology facilitates the realization of precision/personalized medicine.

	He also strongly recommends connecting our research proposals to big ideas/challenges (such as data science) of NSF, NAE, DARPA, DOE, and/or other research funding agency. E.g., "NAE Grand challenges for engineering".

	Regarding NSF's focus on fundamental research, we have to demonstrate that the proposal is not developmental work (the "D" in R&D) nor an incremental improvement of prior work/project. E.g., they don't care about projects regarding software/process development or tool design (i.e., they want you to focus on generating/creating new knowledge, rather than creating artifacts/software/tools/processes), technology transfer, and commercialization of invented technologies. Hence, we should avoid using words such as "develop," "design," "optimize," "control," and "manage" in our research objectives.

	The acceptable (according to Dr. George Hazelrigg, former NSF program director, and Prof. Pei) research objectives for engineering programs in NSF, and to some extent science programs in NSF, are listed as follows.
1) To test hypothesis H
2) To measure parameter P with accuracy A
3) To prove conjecture C
4) To apply method M from field Q to solve problem X in field R
5) (from Prof. Pei) To establish a relationship between A & B, or to establish an effect of A on B.

	The course instructor, Prof. Zhijian Pei at Texas A&M University, encourages us to find a "home program" in NSF, and write proposals mostly for that program. Some research topics can be funded via different NSF programs. Focusing your research on one/two NSF programs can build up your reputation among the proposal reviewers, and help you get funding.

	Proposals are either reviewed by a panel of reviewers, or 2-3 individually mailed reviewers. How the proposals would be reviewed for funding by a NSF program during a given period, or "Call for Proposals," affects how you should write the proposal. For panel reviews, the proposal should be written for a more general audience. For the latter, the proposal should be written for experts in your domain/topic.

	A biographical sketch (or curriculum vitae) based on the required NSF format includes a section on synergistic activities. To boost our chances of winning a NSF award, we can start supervising Masters students and undergrads on research projects, and collaborating with researchers/students from other departments and universities. Study notes that we have made on advanced technologies, and hot research topics, can be turned into course material for courses/classes that we create. We do not have to wait until we become professors to do these. We can start to do these even as Ph.D. students, postdocs, and research scientists.

	Activities to broaden participation of women and people from underrepresented groups (e.g., Latinx people, people of African descent, disabled people, and indigenous folx and Native Americans) are also considered as good synergistic activities, in addition to being a reviewer for journal/conference papers, organizer of research competitions/contests and workshops/conferences.

	You can email professors who are NSF proposal awardees to request to see the "Project Summary" and "Project Description" sections of the their funded NSF proposals (find out the NSF award numbers that are associated with those proposals). See the post-postscript for a email template to do so. This email template is a modified version of the email template recommended by Prof. Pei.

	Lastly, you can attend workshops for writing NSF proposal, with other tenure-track assistant professors.

PP/S: Sample email to contact professors who are NSF proposal awardees.

	Dear Prof. XYZ,
		I am a [Ph.D. student, postdoc, professor] at [name of primary affiliation]. Iâ€™d like to request a copy of your funded proposal (award # [number associated with NSF award, or funded proposal]) to learn about how to write winning NSF proposals. I only need the Project Summary and Project Description sections.

		I can also access the Project Summary and Project Description sections of the aforementioned funded proposal via the NSF Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) officer. Because all funded NSF proposals are in public domain, copies of funded proposals can be obtained through the FOIA officer. However, it will take a long time and the FOIA officer will inform the PI anyway.

		Thank you in advance! I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
[Your name]
