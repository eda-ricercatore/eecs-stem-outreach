\section{Heuristic for Locating Outreach Resources}
\label{heuristiclocateoutreach}

\proc{Find}$(\varphi, \tau)$ is a heuristic for locating resources for outreach activities, which includes finding information about the following: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item awards
\item career resources (including material for career guidance)
\item competitions and contests
\item educational material (e.g., suggested activities and curricular) for specific areas, such as marine sciences and electrical/computer engineering
\item fellowships
\item internships
\item scholarships
\item summer camps
\item summer programs (or summer schools); here, summer schools refer to short educational programs that last from days (e.g., a weekend for the ACM SIGDA Design Automation Summer School) to about a month (e.g., Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer Schools)
\end{enumerate}
\ \\

Its input $\tau$ is the deadline by which this search process must terminate. For example, if I have to apply for internships by next week, I would use the date of a week from now as the deadline $\tau$. In line \ref{find-pt-professional-org}, an example of a professional organization is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The term ``good'' that is used in line \ref{find-pt-gd-uni} is an arbitrary measure of quality determined by the reader/user. \\

A reading group (in line \ref{find-pt-reading-grp}) is a small group of (graduate) students, which may possibly include professors and postdocs, that meet regularly (e.g., once/twice a week) to discuss papers that they have read since the previous meeting/discussion. Each individual in the reading group can be assigned a paper to read and present at the next meeting. The aim of a reading group is to improve the coverage of papers in our research area that each member has read. This is important for interdisciplinary research, since grad students working in interdisciplinary research areas have so much ground to cover. \\

Line \ref{find-pt-athletics} uses the term ``athletics department'' to refer to an administrative department at an American college or university that is in charge of managing varsity/NCAA sports teams. An example of a profession-specific networking organization (line \ref{find-pt-netwk-org}) is DVClub. In line \ref{find-pt-domain-specific-www}, a domain-specific web page is {\it SAT Live!}. An example of a corporate research laboratory (line \ref{find-pt-corporate-research-labs}) is ``Cadence Research Laboratories'' (\url{http://www.cadence.com/cadence/cadence_labs/pages/default.aspx}), and an example of a research institute (line \ref{find-pt-research-institute}) is Santa Fe Institute.

Internship Opportunities in the United States: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Use the Procedure \proc{Find}$(\varphi, \tau)$ in \S\ref{heuristiclocateoutreach} to look up internship opportunities and lists of internship opportunities.

Look at government organizations (e.g., the White House), nonprofit organizations (e.g., Engineers Without Borders), professional organizations (e.g., IEEE and ACM), colleges and universities, and companies (e.g., Intel, Google, and start-ups).

You can start your search by looking at the organizations that provide resources for underrepresented minorities as well as resources for scholarships and fellowships. These information can be found in other sections of this document.

If you do not know where to start, speak to a professor or staff member at the career center of your college/university. Alternatively, you can ask your awesome resident advisors (RAs).

My personal advice is to start your search based on your interests and skill set. You can always narrow the search space based on factors, such as geographical location, later on.

Competitive internships, especially research internships in electrical and computer engineering or computer science, weed out many students from applying via demanding job requirements. For example, if you want to apply for research internships with electronic design automation (EDA) companies and corporate research labs, you would need to have significant experience designing integrated circuits and developing EDA software. The stringent job requirements also mean that students need to plan in advance (say, about a year) about the internships that they would like to seek, and plan to acquire the necessary skill set and experiences before the application deadlines (which can be several months before the start of your internship).

Taking as many challenging classes as you can possibly cope, especially in electrical and computer engineering or computer science, would provide you with a skill set that allows you to apply for competitive internships in many fields. Apart from taking challenging classes as well as engaging in research and/or open source projects, you can try to acquire additional skills and experience in your free time to boost the competitiveness of your internship application. Certain skills and experiences, such as compiler design, are hard to acquire in your free time, so it would be ``easier'' to take classes that would help you acquire those skills and experiences.

Note that you may want to look into creating your own entrepreneurial venture, say an EDA start-up or organization in social entrepreneurship, rather than to seek an internship. Also, seeking an internship abroad is always a good addition to your resume/CV.

		\item During SC10, teams consisting of six students, undergraduate and/or high school, will showcase the amazing power of clusters and the ability to utilize open source software to solve interesting and important problems. They will compete in real-time on the exhibit floor to run a workload of real-world applications on clusters of their own design while never exceeding the dictated power limit.
		\item During SC10 in New Orleans, teams will assemble, test and tune their machines and run the HPCC benchmarks until the starting bell rings on Monday night at the Exhibit Opening Gala where they will be given the competition data sets. In full view of conference attendees, teams will execute the prescribed workload while showing progress and science visualization output on large high-resolution displays in their areas. Teams race to correctly complete the greatest number of application runs during the competition period until the close of the exhibit floor on Wednesday evening.

They will compete in real-time on the exhibit floor to run a workload of real-world applications on clusters of their own design while never exceeding the dictated power limit.
		\item During SC10 in New Orleans, teams will assemble, test and tune their machines and run the HPCC benchmarks until the starting bell rings on Monday night at the Exhibit Opening Gala where they will be given the competition data sets. In full view of conference attendees, teams will execute the prescribed workload while showing progress and science visualization output on large high-resolution displays in their areas. Teams race to correctly complete the greatest number of application runs during the competition period until the close of the exhibit floor on Wednesday evening.
