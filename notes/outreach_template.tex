\begin{abstract} 
This is a list of resources for my outreach activities, which includes helping people explore careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It also includes resources to help parents and teachers of youths prepare youths for college; in addition, it has a list of scholarship resources. Furthermore, it has a list of resources that I use to help me with academic writing. Moreover, it also has resources to help people learn about various markets through publications based on market surveys of industries, such as semiconductors, biotechnology, and green technology. It also has resources for small and home businesses, and start-up entrepreneurship. Finally, it has a list of resources to help people learn material from K-12 through advanced topics for graduate students.

			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
			\item Do not expect people to tell me how to solve certain problems, especially implementation details as a researcher.
			\item Learn to find out for myself what I need to know. That is, determine the scope of things that I need to know, the time frame and deadline(s) in which I should acquire knowledge of those skills and knowledge, and create a plan to acquire those skills and knowledge.
			\item I should learn to be more resourceful, and determine where can I get help. Particularly, resources (e.g., publications and online material), individuals, and networks of people that can provide a significant amount of help to people.
			\item Make a serious effort to solve a problem before I approach others for help. Else, they may get annoyed when I did not bother to learn how to solve problems that are actually very simple. Also, bring my (attempted/considered) solutions to the people who I seek help from. Show them my flow charts, schematics, calculations, algorithms, and heuristics. This would convince them that I have done my homework, and am not asking bane questions.
			\item To help me understand how to apply the skills and knowledge that I am acquiring in ``practical, real-world applications,'' I should look at textbooks (including alternative textbooks/books, such as handbooks and encyclopedias) for such examples. I can also look ahead further in the chapter, book, or books of subsequent classes to see how these skills and knowledge will be applied. Note that information that I skip while reading my textbook, manuals, and guides may actually contain the solution that I am looking for. Think of the questions that I asked Anders Franzen about the SMT-LIB manual during my internship at FBK while working on the {\it MathSAT} project. I did not understand the material in the manual, since I lacked a background in compiler design and formal grammar/languages. So, I had to get he to help me interpret what I was reading. This was like when I was learning about UNIX as a freshman/sophomore. I did not understand what I was reading when I looked at the UNIX manual (``man pages''). Thus, I shall learn how to read technical literature better.
			\item By reading technical and semi-technical magazines and newspapers/newsletters, I can learn about ``practical, real-world applications'' of the things that I am learning about. In addition, by talking to others (students further ahead of me in engineering education and professional engineers), I learn to see how can I apply the things that I am learning about in ``practical, real-world applications''. Furthermore, I can tap into the newsletters and technical magazines of professional organizations, such as ACM and IEEE, to find out about research opportunities/projects where I can apply what I am learning about.
			\item If my lecture slides/notes and textbooks(s) do not have adequate worked-out examples (e.g., only trivial examples) to help me understand mathematical theories and formulas, and engineering concepts, I shall seek other resources. E.g., I can look at lecture slides/notes from equivalent/similar classes that are taught at other universities. In addition, I can look at other textbooks/books on this subject. Note that for advanced topics, such as those covered by advanced graduate classes, I may only be able to find 1 or 2 books on this topic. So, I may not always have the luxury of looking at worked examples from other textbooks; e.g., I could find many textbooks for differential equations and vector analysis, but not for antenna analysis or satisfiability modulo theories.
			\item I shall improve my ability to work out problems on my own if I cannot find adequate examples for that problem or similar problems. In addition, I shall document worked solutions digitally, so that I can refer to them during revision for an exam, my prelims/quals, or when I encounter a similar problem during research and development.
			\item I shall also improve the way I revise/relearn concepts, technologies, skills, and knowledge. Documenting resources and prior solutions to problems would help me relearn things. Such documentation requires proper information management, so that I can reuse the previously acquired knowledge and skills. Remember that using \LaTeX\ on a UNIX-like operating system helps me with information management.
			\item If I do not understand how and why things work, determine if knowledge of that is required for solving problems in my research/class project, or assignment. If not, I can move on and address this when I have more free time (e.g., ``slack'' periods during the calendar year). To find out more about how certain things work, I can look into the references in my lecture slides/notes and textbooks(s), or search/google for references online. Note that learning how and why certain things work may require (advanced) knowledge that is outside the scope of my discipline or research area. Hence, it is important to know when to stop delving into (/investigating/probing) a concept/technique. Remember my problems with understanding Prof. Sanjit A. Seshia’s publications on adaptive eager encodings, in which he used ``polyhedral theory'' (I believe in the context of integer programming and combinatorial optimization) to prove a theorem regarding the satisfiability of UTVPI formulas? Ditto for lambda expressions (and lambda calculus) so that I can understand how syntax is represented for
	a given signature in first-order logic.]
			\item I shall improve my ability to convert descriptions of architectures and techniques into hardware/software implementations. It is easier to grasp the concepts in pseudocode, flowcharts, schematics, figures, and demonstrations than to learn the concepts from text and create abstractions of those concepts on my own. I shall improve my ability to create pseudocode, flowcharts, schematics, figures, and demonstrations from what I have read, especially in journal and conference papers.
			\item I shall improve my ability to perform statistical analysis on my experimental data, and analyze the figures/graphs that I have plotted.
			\item Use a book from the {\it Schaum's Outline} series from {\it McGraw-Hill} to help me learn material from introductory and intermediate classes. ``Even if you can't find a reference with exactly the type of coverage that works best for you, just reading about the same topic in two different places usually clarifies the ideas.'' [Remember how I read about the same topic in different advance engineering math textbooks to learn concepts for my classes in differential equations and vector analysis?]
			\item Working with others allows me to overcome obstacles that I may not be able to overcome on my own. While I may give up on learning certain things or overcome specific problems in individual projects, my teammates may be able to come up with solutions to problems in group projects. In addition, working in a diverse group exposes me to solutions that can be more effective and/or efficient... $students routinely teach one another in group work -- and as any professor will tell you, teaching something is probably the most effective way to learn it.$
			\item Try to find groups of three to four people to work on a problem. When I work in pairs, I may not expose myself to a sufficient variety of approaches. Similarly, when I work in larger groups (i.e., $> 4$), some individuals may be left out of the ``active problem-solving process''.
			\item I shall endeavor to outline solution on my own first, without being boggled or encumbered by the implementation details. Subsequently, I can work out the complete solutions with my group. If each individual does this, each group member can learn how to get started in solving problems in the project. That is, let's outline solutions to the problem, before we meet to discuss our considered solutions and develop the complete solution together.
			\item ``For group work to be fully effective, every group member should be able to explain in detail every solution obtained in a work session. Having the group members (particularly the weaker ones) go through these explanations before ending the session is a good way to make sure that the session has achieved its objectives.'' This will mitigate the tendency for the more technically challenged and reserved individuals to accept proposed solutions without understanding those solutions.

Available at: \url{http://codemonkeyism.com/7-signs-work-software-company/}; last accessed on September 5, 2010. The ``7 bad signs not to work for a software company or startup are'': \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item No Source Control
	\item No top tools or only home brewed ones (IDE, Build System, …)
	\item No business model or not enough money
	\item They don’t let you talk to or see developers
	\item High turnover
	\item Hiring is mainly done by HR, not by developers/technical staff
	\item No decent hardware

\item Guy Kawasaki, ``Guy Kawasaki's 10 Questions to Ask Before You Join a Startup,'' on July 21, 2009. Available at: \url{http://www.mint.com/blog/how-to/guy-kawasaki-startup-tips/}; last accessed on September 5, 2010. Questions: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item How much money do you have in the bank?
	\item What is your net outflow per month?
	\item What is the post-money valuation of your last round?
	\item What can you do that your competitors cannot?
	\item What can your competitors do that you cannot?

\item A good place for garage-stage start-ups, or even seed-stage start-ups, to work is a coworking environment. These environments have to be functional and conducive for work, so that we can be productive. That said, coworking environments provide an atmosphere that is ``social, energetic, and creative,'' just like research and computer labs at good research universities (and at coffee shops in the Silicon Valley). In addition, these environments allow us to have our own working space that is affordable. \vspace{-0.3cm}
