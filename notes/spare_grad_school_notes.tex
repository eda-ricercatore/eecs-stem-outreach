\subsubsection{\hspace{0.1in} Grad School Information}
\label{gradschinfo}

Things for me to look into when considering graduate and professional programs: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Is the graduate or professional program accredited?
\item Would attending the graduate/professional program help me obtain my career goals?
\item Would attending the graduate/professional program help me obtain my career goals?
\item See \url{http://gradschool.princeton.edu/facts/time_to_degree/naturalsciences/} for statistics of graduates from various programs at Princeton University.
\item Some statistics that you may wanna look into include, average number of Ph.D. students per Ph.D. advisor (tells you about advisor-to-advisee ratios), number of Ph.D. graduates for the Ph.D. program per year (tells you about the size of the department), graduate outcomes (what did alumni do after their Ph.D. programs), drop-out rate, failure rate for Ph.D. preliminary and qualifying examinations, and reasons for dropping out of the Ph.D. program.
\item Some research labs do list the names of alumni members (Ph.D. and Masters students, undergraduates, and postdocs). They may also include their first vocation after their Ph.D. program, and what are they currently doing. You can use this to help you gauge the strengths/weaknesses of the lab/advisor.
\item Accommodation options. Is it hard to find housing in the surrounding area? Is housing in the surrounding area cheap? What are some of the statistics of the local population? LA Times has some statistics of local populations in LA. You can determine the average income, highest level of education, political views, and so on... Try to determine if there is an equivalent of that for the local area.

				\item Getting the most out of the relationship with your research advisor or boss: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item {\bf Meet regularly} - you should insist on meeting once a week or at least every other week because it gives you motivation to make regular progress and it keeps your advisor aware of your work.
					\item {\bf Prepare for your meetings} - come to each meeting with: List of topics to discuss; Plan for what you hope to get out of the meeting; Summary of you have done since your last meeting; List of any upcoming deadlines; \& Notes from your previous meeting
					\item {\bf Email him/her a brief summary of EVERY meeting} - this helps avoid misunderstandings and provides a great record of your research progress. Include (where applicable): Time and plan for next meeting; New summary of what you think you are doing; To do list for yourself; To do list for your advisor; List of related work to read; List of major topics discussed; List of what you agreed on; \& List of advice that you may not follow
					\item {\bf Show your advisor the results of your work as soon as possible} - this will help your advisor understand your research and identify potential points of conflict early in the process. Summaries of related work. Anything you write about your research. Experimental results.
					\item {\bf Communicate clearly} - if you disagree with your advisor, state your objections or concerns clearly and calmly. If you feel something about your relationship is not working well, discuss it with him or her. Whenever possible, suggest steps they could take to address your concerns.
					\item {\bf Take the initiative} - you do not need to clear every activity with your advisor. He/she has a lot of work to do too. You must be responsible for your own research ideas and progress.
					\end{itemize}
				\item Getting the most out of what you read: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item {\bf Be organized}. Keep an electronic bibliography with notes \& pointers to the paper files. Keep and file all the papers you have read or skimmed.
					\item {\bf Be efficient} - only read what you need to. Start by reading only the conclusion, scanning figures \& tables, and looking at their references. Read the other sections only if the paper seems relevant or you think it may help you get a different perspective. Skip the sections that you already understand (often the background and motivation sections).
					\item {\bf Take notes on every paper you find worth reading} - What problem are they trying to solve? What is their approach? How is it different from other approaches?
					\item {\bf Summarize what you have read on each topic} -- after you have read several papers covering some topic, note the: key problems; various formulations of the problem they are addressing; relationship among the various approaches; and alternative approaches
					\item {\bf Read Ph.D. theses} -- even though they are long they can be very helpful in quickly learning about what has been done is some field. Especially focus on: Background sections; Method sections; and Your advisor's thesis (this will give you an idea for what he/she expects from you).
					\end{itemize}
				\item Making continual progress on your research: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item {\bf Keep a journal of your ideas} - write down everything you are thinking about even if you think it is stupid. It will help you keep track of your progress and keep you from going in circles. Do not plan to share it with anyone, so you can write freely.
					\item {\bf Set some reasonable goals with deadlines}: Identify key tasks that need to be completed; Set a reasonable date for completing them (on the order of weeks or months); Share this with your advisor or enlist your advisors help in creating the goals and deadlines; and Set some deadlines that you must keep (e.g., volunteer to give a student seminar on your research, work toward a conference paper submission deadline, etc.)
					\item {\bf Keep a to do list} - Checking off things on a to do list can feel very rewarding when you are working on a long-term project. List the small tasks that can be done in about an hour. Pick at least one that has to be completed each day.
					\item {\bf Continually update your: Problem statement}, Goals, Approach (or a list of possible approaches); One-minute version of your research (aka the elevator ride summary); and Five-minute version of your research
					\item {\bf Discuss your research with anyone who will listen} - use your fellow students, friends, family, etc. to practice discussing your research on various levels. They may have useful insights or you may find that verbalizing your ideas clarifies them for yourself.
					\item {\bf Write about your work}. Early stage: Write short idea papers and share them with your advisor and colleagues. Intermediate stage: Find workshops and conferences for submitting preliminary results. This can also help you set deadlines. Advanced stage: Target relevant journals.
					\item {\bf Avoid distractions} - it is easy to ignore your research in favor of more structured tasks such as taking classes, teaching classes, organizing student activities, creating web pages like this, etc. Minimize these kinds of activities or commitments.
					\item {\bf Confront your fears and weaknesses}: If you are afraid of public speaking, volunteer to give lots of talks. If you are afraid your ideas are stupid, discuss them with someone. If you are afraid of writing, write something about your research every day. One-minute version of your research (aka the elevator ride summary). Five-minute version of your research. List of advice that you may not follow.
					\item {\bf Balance reading, thinking, writing and hacking} - often research needs to be an iterative process across all of those tasks.
					\item {\bf Finding a thesis topic or formulating a research plan}. Pick something you find interesting - if you work on something solely because your advisor wants you to, it will be difficult to stay motivated ... Pick something your advisor finds interesting - if your advisor doesn't find it interesting he/she is unlikely to devote much time to your research. He/she will be even more motivated to help you if your project is on their critical path (although this has down sides too! )... Pick something the research community will find interesting - if you want to make yourself marketable... Make sure it addresses a real problem. Remember that your topic will evolve as you work on it. Pick something that is narrow enough that it can be done in a reasonable time frame. Have realistic expectations (i.e. Don't expect the Nobel Prize ). Don't worry that you will be stuck in this area for the rest of your career. It is very likely that you will be doing very different research after you graduate.
					\end{itemize}
				\item Characteristics to look for in a good advisor, mentor, boss, or committee member: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item It is unreasonable to expect one person to have all of the qualities you desire. You should choose thesis committee members who are strong in the areas where your advisor is weak.
					\item {\bf Willing to meet with you regularly (about 1 hour every week or every other week). You can trust him/her to}: Give you credit for the work you do; Defend your work when you are not around; Tell you when your work is or is not good enough; Help you graduate in a reasonable time frame; and Look out for you professionally and personally
					\item {\bf Is interested in your topic. Has good personal and communication skills}: You can talk freely and easily about research ideas; Tells you when you are doing something stupid; Patient, Never feels threatened by your capabilities; Helps motivate you and keep you unstuck
					\end{itemize}
				\item {\bf Has good technical skills}. Can provide constructive criticism of papers you write or talks you give. Knows if what you are doing is good enough for a good thesis. Can help you figure out what you are not doing well; Can help you improve your skills; Can suggest related articles to read or people to talk to; Can tell you or help you discover if what you are doing has already been done; Can help you set and obtain reasonable goals. Will be around until you finish. Is well respected in his/her field. Has good connections for the type of job you would want when you graduate; Willing and able to provide financial and computing support.
				\item {\bf Avoiding the research blues}: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item When you meet your goals, reward yourself.
					\item Don't compare yourself to senior researchers who have many more years of work and publications.
					\item Don't be afraid to leave part of your research problem for future work.
					\item Exercise.
					\item Use the student counseling services
					\item Occasionally, do something fun without feeling guilty!

				\item A Ph.D. ``is a research degree,'' and an ``apprentice in research''. It is ``awarded for a significant and substantial piece of research,'' and ``examined by experts and defended in a viva.''
				\item Research is about finding out about something, and discovering how to do that. It involves taking responsibility for organizing my time and taking charge of the investigation.
				\item Doing a Ph.D. is exciting as I ``carry out investigations into [the] unknown,'' and it is ``enriching to learn and master new techniques'' while doing so.

			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
			\item Do not expect people to tell me how to solve certain problems, especially implementation details as a researcher.
			\item Learn to find out for myself what I need to know. That is, determine the scope of things that I need to know, the time frame and deadline(s) in which I should acquire knowledge of those skills and knowledge, and create a plan to acquire those skills and knowledge.
			\item I should learn to be more resourceful, and determine where can I get help. Particularly, resources (e.g., publications and online material), individuals, and networks of people that can provide a significant amount of help to people.
			\item Make a serious effort to solve a problem before I approach others for help. Else, they may get annoyed when I did not bother to learn how to solve problems that are actually very simple. Also, bring my (attempted/considered) solutions to the people who I seek help from. Show them my flow charts, schematics, calculations, algorithms, and heuristics. This would convince them that I have done my homework, and am not asking bane questions.
			\item To help me understand how to apply the skills and knowledge that I am acquiring in ``practical, real-world applications,'' I should look at textbooks (including alternative textbooks/books, such as handbooks and encyclopedias) for such examples. I can also look ahead further in the chapter, book, or books of subsequent classes to see how these skills and knowledge will be applied. Note that information that I skip while reading my textbook, manuals, and guides may actually contain the solution that I am looking for. Think of the questions that I asked Anders Franzen about the SMT-LIB manual during my internship at FBK while working on the {\it MathSAT} project. I did not understand the material in the manual, since I lacked a background in compiler design and formal grammar/languages. So, I had to get he to help me interpret what I was reading. This was like when I was learning about UNIX as a freshman/sophomore. I did not understand what I was reading when I looked at the UNIX manual (``man pages''). Thus, I shall learn how to read technical literature better.
			\item By reading technical and semi-technical magazines and newspapers/newsletters, I can learn about ``practical, real-world applications'' of the things that I am learning about. In addition, by talking to others (students further ahead of me in engineering education and professional engineers), I learn to see how can I apply the things that I am learning about in ``practical, real-world applications''. Furthermore, I can tap into the newsletters and technical magazines of professional organizations, such as ACM and IEEE, to find out about research opportunities/projects where I can apply what I am learning about.
			\item If my lecture slides/notes and textbooks(s) do not have adequate worked-out examples (e.g., only trivial examples) to help me understand mathematical theories and formulas, and engineering concepts, I shall seek other resources. E.g., I can look at lecture slides/notes from equivalent/similar classes that are taught at other universities. In addition, I can look at other textbooks/books on this subject. Note that for advanced topics, such as those covered by advanced graduate classes, I may only be able to find 1 or 2 books on this topic. So, I may not always have the luxury of looking at worked examples from other textbooks; e.g., I could find many textbooks for differential equations and vector analysis, but not for antenna analysis or satisfiability modulo theories.
			\item I shall improve my ability to work out problems on my own if I cannot find adequate examples for that problem or similar problems. In addition, I shall document worked solutions digitally, so that I can refer to them during revision for an exam, my prelims/quals, or when I encounter a similar problem during research and development.
			\item I shall also improve the way I revise/relearn concepts, technologies, skills, and knowledge. Documenting resources and prior solutions to problems would help me relearn things. Such documentation requires proper information management, so that I can reuse the previously acquired knowledge and skills. Remember that using \LaTeX\ on a UNIX-like operating system helps me with information management.
			\item If I do not understand how and why things work, determine if knowledge of that is required for solving problems in my research/class project, or assignment. If not, I can move on and address this when I have more free time (e.g., ``slack'' periods during the calendar year). To find out more about how certain things work, I can look into the references in my lecture slides/notes and textbooks(s), or search/google for references online. Note that learning how and why certain things work may require (advanced) knowledge that is outside the scope of my discipline or research area. Hence, it is important to know when to stop delving into (/investigating/probing) a concept/technique. Remember my problems with understanding Prof. Sanjit A. Seshias publications on adaptive eager encodings, in which he used ``polyhedral theory'' (I believe in the context of integer programming and combinatorial optimization) to prove a theorem regarding the satisfiability of UTVPI formulas? Ditto for lambda expressions (and lambda calculus) so that I can understand how syntax is represented for
	a given signature in first-order logic.]
			\item I shall improve my ability to convert descriptions of architectures and techniques into hardware/software implementations. It is easier to grasp the concepts in pseudocode, flowcharts, schematics, figures, and demonstrations than to learn the concepts from text and create abstractions of those concepts on my own. I shall improve my ability to create pseudocode, flowcharts, schematics, figures, and demonstrations from what I have read, especially in journal and conference papers.
			\item I shall improve my ability to perform statistical analysis on my experimental data, and analyze the figures/graphs that I have plotted.
			\item Use a book from the {\it Schaum's Outline} series from {\it McGraw-Hill} to help me learn material from introductory and intermediate classes. ``Even if you can't find a reference with exactly the type of coverage that works best for you, just reading about the same topic in two different places usually clarifies the ideas.'' [Remember how I read about the same topic in different advance engineering math textbooks to learn concepts for my classes in differential equations and vector analysis?]
			\item Working with others allows me to overcome obstacles that I may not be able to overcome on my own. While I may give up on learning certain things or overcome specific problems in individual projects, my teammates may be able to come up with solutions to problems in group projects. In addition, working in a diverse group exposes me to solutions that can be more effective and/or efficient... {\it students routinely teach one another in group work -- and as any professor will tell you, teaching something is probably the most effective way to learn it.}
			\item Try to find groups of three to four people to work on a problem. When I work in pairs, I may not expose myself to a sufficient variety of approaches. Similarly, when I work in larger groups (i.e., $> 4$), some individuals may be left out of the ``active problem-solving process''.
			\item I shall endeavor to outline solution on my own first, without being boggled or encumbered by the implementation details. Subsequently, I can work out the complete solutions with my group. If each individual does this, each group member can learn how to get started in solving problems in the project. That is, let's outline solutions to the problem, before we meet to discuss our considered solutions and develop the complete solution together.
			\item ``For group work to be fully effective, every group member should be able to explain in detail every solution obtained in a work session. Having the group members (particularly the weaker ones) go through these explanations before ending the session is a good way to make sure that the session has achieved its objectives.'' This will mitigate the tendency for the more technically challenged and reserved individuals to accept proposed solutions without understanding those solutions.
