#	Speech for the Fall 2016 Opening Ceremony for the MSC CAMAC's "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" Program



## Author's note

I am soliciting feedback, revisions, and corrections for this speech before the ceremony next week. I am tagging some people at the end of the note... Any input from anybody would be greatly appreciated. 


## The Speech

  I have many fond memories of the "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" dinners that I have attended. For me, it was far more than the delicious meals served by faculty and staff at Texas A&M University, and their significant others, in their homes. The deep and meaningful conversations that students have with the hosts, as our authentic selves, allowed students to recognize that we are not alone in our ventures, endeavors, and struggles.


  These dinners showed the concern that the hosts have for students, including first-generation college students and students in the Latinx/Hispanic community on campus. While I am not a first-generation college student, I am a first-generation doctoral student. And, many of the things we discussed apply to me, too. Hence, I could learn not just from the more matured and wiser hosts, but also from wise, brilliant, and amazing students who were my fellow guests.


  I love how the dinners provide opportunities for students to see how the hosts love their significant others, and their children or siblings, and have a good work/life balance. They serve as role models for students who may not have a lot of exposure to families with healthy relationships. Also, the nice, pretty, and big houses that they live in serve as nice goals for the college-educated students to work towards.


  In addition, the dinners allow me to learn more about Latinx/Hispanic subcultures, and teaches me not to be jealous of many wonderful customs, traditions, and practices that my fellow students have experienced in their youth. It points me to a future, if and when I get married and become a father, where I can expose my children to such customs, traditions, and practices. It helps me learn to be a better ally for marginalized students, and gives me experiences that would shape my diversity/teaching statements if and when I apply for tenure-track junior faculty positions at Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs).


  It helps me learn to build a good rapport with faculty and staff on campus, and not be afraid of interacting with them. My experiences in these dinners help me to manage my anxiety and worries when I have to talk to professors during office hours, after class, during weekly meetings with my Ph.D. advisor, and around campus. Similarly, I have been able to build better rapport with staff, including Chartwells' staff who clean our campus and cook our meals.
