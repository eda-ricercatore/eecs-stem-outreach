#	Speech for the "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" Closing Ceremony [Long version]




## Author's Note

 I was asked to give a speech at the Closing ceremony of the "Mi Casa es Su Casa" program, which is run by the Memorial Student Center Committee for the Awareness of Mexican-American Culture (MSC CAMAC) at Texas A&M University. The organizers wanted me to say something about myself before commenting on my experiences at the "Mi Casa es Su Casa" dinners. The dinners are meant to help undergraduates, especially frosh, first-generation college students, and transfer students, improve student-faculty and student-staff rapport. The program does this by inviting students, including graduate students and international students, at Texas A&M to have dinners with faculty and staff at Texas A&M. See http://camac.tamu.edu/micasa.html. Competence in the Spanish language and/or deep knowledge of issues affecting Hispanic and Latino/Latina Americans and immigrants is not required. However, I would strongly encourage student participants to learn some basic Spanish and something about issues that Hispanic and Latino/Latina Americans and immigrants face.







## The Speech


I am not-so-loud but proud member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 20??... I can't predict when I would finish my Ph.D. dissertation... Anyway, I would describe myself as a globetrotting cultural chameleon who studied/worked in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Los Angeles, Trento and Verona in Italy, and Taiwan.

I love challenges, and enjoy doing the hardest thing I can possibly do. I was a reconnaissance soldier, ran outdoor track events from 3,000 meter steeplechase through to 10,000 in Australia, and cross country at USC with a future Olympian and under the watchful eyes of his infinitely patient coach, a former world-record holder in the 1,500 meters. In research, I have worked with the top researchers and professors in various research problems in electronic design automation and formal verification. This assertion is based on empirical results that they or their students achieved in research contests, and their victories over MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, Microsoft Research, Intel Labs, and IBM Research.

[I ignored this paragraph while giving the speech. I wrote it, since the organizers wanted me to say something about myself, before commenting on my experiences at the "Mi Casa es Su Casa" dinners.]

When I was in Italy and Taiwan, I missed cultural events in my residential colleges at USC and the University of Adelaide that encourage professional and personal development. The resident faculty of my dorms would eat with us during breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They would attend some events organized by the resident advisors, and interact with students. Each Monday, they would interact with students during they called "Masters dinner" or "Formal Tea".

I heard about the "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" program during involvement fair in Spring 2014. However, I could not attend any of the events last year, since they clashed with my Bible study meetings. This past winter break, I changed my mind about the program, since I would only miss 2/3 Bible study meetings per semester. As I am seeking a career as a professor or researcher, I figured participating in the "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" program would allow me to improve student-faculty and student-staff rapport. It would allow me to learn from other students, not necessarily Spanish-speaking or Hispanic. It would also allow me to hone my intercultural competence and practice my Spanish language skills (basically similarly sounding Italian words and phrases). In addition, it helps me understand different Latino and Latina subcultures, so that when I interact with Hispanic students in class, in the dining hall, research conferences, or at church, I can forge stronger friendships with them. I also realize that the faculty and staff that I interact with can give me plenty of priceless advice and guide me in my career development, and address various personal and emotional issues along the way. For example, the challenges of being a first-generation doctoral student, an international student, a minority, a n-th generation immigrant who does not know many cultural aspects of my Chinese Singaporean parents nor competently communicate in Mandarin, and of being a wandering academic.

My experience in the program has been incredibly amazing, wonderful, and awesome. While I only attended one event, I had an amazing time at the home of professors Victor and Norma Arizpe that blew my mind. The dinner conversation was so good that I lost track of time. By the time I realized that I was not gonna make it to Bible study, I was reluctant to leave the dining table. I know that getting my cell phone in a closet near the entrance of the house to call my Bible study group leader would mean missing out on parts of the deep and meaningful conversation.

At the dining table with some Latina students and Prof. Norma Arizpe, we talked about many topics. Prof. Arizpe spoke about how important her class on Spanish medical terminology is. It reminded me of how a teammate (of normal hearing) on the USC cross country team learned American Sign Language prior to going to medical school, so that she would be able to provide better medical care for the hearing impaired when she gets her M.D.. We shared many aspects of our upbringing and cultures. We talked about issues that gripped other students like sexual assaults on campus as well as the issues faced by minorities on campus and first-generation college students.

Prof. Arizpe also talked about the importance for us to keep speaking the language of our parents, and to keep various aspects of the cultures of our family. For example, many second and third generation Hispanic Americans have problems communicating in Spanish. This is not lost on me, since I cannot speak Mandarin adequately as a n-th generation Chinese Singaporean, or even write my name in Chinese. Ironically, my Mom is a retired teacher who used to teach Mandarin in elementary schools. Also, we talked about code switching and our struggles with learning multiple languages as well as how the Spanish language can vary between Spain and different regions in the Americas.

When my newly-made Latina friends were sharing cultural aspects of their upbringing, it was hard not to be envious of their families and upbringing. That said, I do realize that I had culturally stripped and deracinated myself to the point that I cannot recognize the unique aspects of my Singaporean and Chinese identities. I got to experience the phenomenal of small-world networks again, as people shared stories of how they had mutual friends and acquaintances. In addition, they shared stories about being mentored by amazing people, like Señorita Genesis Ponce. They also shared tips about excelling in college. In addition, I learned about the meaning of the Quinceañera event of a Latina's life. When I realized that CAMAC was hosting the "Mis Quince" event for a Latina's Quinceañera, Señorita Genesis Ponce helped me connect with Señorita Amanda Flores, who helped me processed my small donation for the event.

I also learned how wonderful and amazing the Latina students who I was dining with. I realized that I had similar experiences with Señorita Paola Martinez in terms of our struggles with learning Italian. For example, we realized the need to pay attention to accents in characters and repeated characters (such as capello and cappello). After being insulted by many Chinese and Singaporean people for not knowing my parents' languages sufficiently well, I was heartened to know that I am not the only one who cannot write effectively in the language of my parents. Señorita Martinez had some struggles with written Spanish. When I learned about the family traditions of the wonderful and amazing Señorita Martinez, I thought about what kind of traditions would I want my children that I would have to keep. I also learned how smart, lovely, strong, loving and caring, Señorita Karyna Valencia is. She shared many stories of being in the Corps. One story that stuck out was how she got pricked by safety pins while helping her buddy make his bed. I can certainly see myself crying or cussing, let alone patiently and promptly getting the job done. I like the way she sang praises of others, regardless of how she may have been treated. When she talked about how her buddies consider her to be like their Moms, it reminded me of female friends who I perceive to my big sister or Mom. Hence, I would call them Mommy, Mamma, or Mommy ji.

At the end of the night, when everybody gathered together, I learned from Prof. Victor Arizpe how a man can honor and care for his wife, look after her interests, and share his affections for her. Like some other Ph.D. students, the two-body problem of dual-career academic couples is intimidating. Hearing stories of struggling or failed marriages of dual-career academic couples does not help either. So, it was heartening to see Prof. Victor Arizpe offer his seat to his wife. Also, Prof. Norma Arizpe confirmed stories about how Prof. Victor Arizpe had courted her with recitals of Spanish poetry. This was not lost on me. Despite being single all my life, I am glad that I did something right. I wrote poetry to sing praises of my good female friends, who showered me with love, went out of their way to help me, prayed for me, and mentored me. I even got some of them customized aprons with Bible verses from the gift shop of "Club di Giulietta" (Juliet's Club in Italian), or rather the museum associated with Juliet's house. It is the club of Juliet, from the story of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. The story is set in Verona, Italy.

The dinner conversation lasted more than four hours, and it reminded me of the amazing dinner conversations that I had with people in Italy. Also, this is very meaningful to me as an international student, since I have been to homes of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and white Americans and experienced things from perspectives that many international students haven't.

There is not doubt that this is an amazing experience that will stand out in my time as an Aggie and as an international student in the US. However, it is not lost on me that many Latino and Latina students do not adequately take advantage of opportunities and services on campus. Many of their peers in less privileged institutions do not have access to such opportunities. This is not lost on me, especially since I have considered becoming a professor at a Hispanic-serving institution or a historically black college or university.

When my midterm for my nanobiotechnology class caused me to miss my ride for the "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" dinner in March, I was very upset. For consoling, I practiced my Italian with an American of Italian, French, and Persian descent over dinner at Sbisa, which is nothing compared to the food that I had at the home of professors Victor and Norma Arizpe, and went to Bible study like any other Thursday. However, the wonderful and awesome Señorita Genesis Ponce and Señorita Rebeca Diaz were willing to try and help me get a ride to my host faculty/staff. And, I learned that the world does not revolve around me.

Two Tuesdays ago, at the "Community of Scholars" event at the MSC, I had dinner with Prof. María Irene Moyna from the Hispanic Studies department and some other students. Prof. Moyna found out that my "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" hosts were the awesome Arizpe family, and she encouraged me to treasure my experiences interacting with them and other Aggies. From now till I graduate, I look forward to having more "Mi Casa Es Su Casa" dinners with them and other Aggies.


This is a short Spanish poem that I wrote.
¡Qué hermosa velada
Una deliciosa cena con los profesores y los amigos
Una maravillosa conversación que se prolongó durante horas
Gente increíble, comida deliciosa, fantástica conversación
¿Qué más puedo pedir?


Señor Arturo Lara, Señorita Rebeca Diaz, and Señorita Genesis Ponce, thank you so much for allowing me to participate in this wonderful program. Once again, thank you Prof. Victor Arizpe and Prof. Norma Arizpe for hosting amazing Aggies and myself in your home.

Buenas noches!
