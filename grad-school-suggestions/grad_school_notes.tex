\section{\hspace{0.1in} Preliminary Ph.D. Thesis Proposal}
\label{phdthesisproposal}

The full Ph.D. dissertation proposal is approximately 20-50 pages with appropriate tradeoffs between what others have done, what the student has done, and what the student will do. \\
\ \\
Things to be included in my preliminary Ph.D. thesis proposal (preliminary research proposal): \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item This may also be known as the ``PhD plan''
\item This project proposal shall be about 5-10 pages 
\item This can or should be completed in cooperation with my main supervisor(s)
\item Abstract of the research proposal: include field for keywords to indicate the scope of the project
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	Begin description of research proposal
\item Project description (0.5-1 page): \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -3pt
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	Introduction
	\item {\bf \color{green} Introduction:} \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
		\item provide a general introduction to what the thesis is all about
		\item it is not just a description of the contents of each section
		\item briefly summarize the research problem/question (I shall be stating the research problem/question in detail later)
		\item also, provide a summary for some of the reasons why it is a worthwhile question
		\item {\tt For the Ph.D. thesis ONLY: give an overview of my main results}
		\item this is a bird's-eye view of the answers to the main questions answered in the thesis
		\item set up the basis of the research
		\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	Background information
	\item {\bf \color{green} Background Information (optional):} \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
		\item a brief section giving background information may be necessary, especially if your work spans two or more traditional fields
		\item that means that your readers may not have any experience with some of the material needed to follow your thesis, so you need to give it to them
		\item a different title than that given above is usually better; e.g., ``A Brief Review of Frammis Algebra.'' 
		\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	Problem statement, research hypothesis, and objectives
	\item {\bf \color{green} Research Question or Problem Statement:} \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
		\item Problem formulation.
		\item The problem statement should be comprehensible by faculty in the department who are not in the particular specialty of the student and the advisor.
		\item Preliminary considerations: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item What is the considered scope, or focus of my Ph.D. research?
			\item What's my vision? And, what's my research topic?
			\item Which issues will I be considering?
			\item Is my proposed research topic well-defined and specific?
			\item Is it novel?
			\item If this research topic is competently investigated, is it significant enough to be worthy of a Ph.D.? 
			\end{enumerate}
% Engineering theses tend to refer to a ``problem'' to be solved, whereas other disciplines talk in terms of a ``question'' to be answered.
		\item What problem(s) am I solving?: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item What is the problem?
			\item provide a clear explanation of the problem(s) to be worked on
			\item Succinctly state the research problem and its significance: \vspace{-0.2cm}
				\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
				\item use a concise statement of the problem that my research will attempt to solve
				\item omit vague terms in my problem statement... for example, do not say ``develop a Zylon algorithm capable of handling very large scale problems in reasonable time''; specify ``large scale'' and ``reasonable time'' by describing what I mean in numerical figures, or numerical scale (e.g. ultra-deep submicron technologies, nanoscale architectures, exabyte data storage, or THz imaging)
				\item definition of the problem space
				\item list keyword to define your topic
				\item state your research topic as a problem/question
				\item think about the significant terms, concepts, and keywords that describe your topic. 
				\item these terms will become the (search) keys while searching for information about your subject in library catalogs, online databases, and other resources.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate}
		\item {\bf \color{magenta} What is so interesting about this/(these) problem(s)? } \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item Why is the problem important?
			\item Have I identified a worthwhile problem/question that has not been solved/answered?
			\item Is this open problem indicated in a number of the papers that I have read?
% In science and mathematics, an open problem or an open question is a known problem that can be accurately stated, and has not yet been solved (no solution for it is known)
			\item for open problems (unresolved issues), provide a justification, by direct reference to a literature review, to indicate that my research problem is unsolved
			\item else, indicate that the problem has not been solved adequately, or its solutions may not be as effective in the near future as technologies improve
			\item alternatively, say... given existing architectural scaling trends (or process technology scaling trends), this problem would remerge since current solutions do not scale well (with respect to architectural scaling trends, or process technology scaling trends). Hence, these solutions may not be able to adequately handle BLAH ISSUES with advanced architectures (or process technologies). In this case, more extensive justification for the selection of this research problem can be given later in the literature review section
			\item analyze the information read during my literature review, and indicate how each class/category of current approaches fails; i.e., current approaches can handle only small problems, and/or takes too much time
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Discussion of why it is worthwhile to solve this problem: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item What are my motivations for solving this problem?
			\item How would my work extend the cutting edge in this field?
			\item Why is it useful to have a solution to this problem?
			\item Who would care if I have a solution to this problem? R\&D teams in high-tech companies??? University research labs???
			\item What are the wider implications of my research?
			\end{enumerate}
		\item To highlight this section (i.e., Problem Statement), try to include the term ``{\tt Problem Statement}'' in a fairly specific section title. For example, ``The Large-Scale Zylon Algorithm Problem.''
		\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	Literature review
	\item {\bf \color{green} Review of the State of the Art:} \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
		\item {\bf \color{magenta} Survey of the state of the art (2-5 pages approx.); 5-10 pages in a typical thesis proposal, but is longer in the ``prior work'' section of a Ph.D. dissertation}
		\item this section shall be longer if there exists rich literature for my research topic
		\item make ample references to existing literature in the field
		\item this literature review section can serve as the nucleus for such a chapter in my Ph.D. dissertation; since the chapter in Ph.D. dissertation is longer, it pays to do a extensive literature review early on for my research proposal and keep up to date with advancements in the field
		\item What has been done so far on the problem?
		\item How does it relate to previous work in the field?
		\item Include a brief introduction to my topic, and introduce key concepts
		\item What is the cutting edge in my field? State-of-the-art solution(s) of the problem.
		\item {\it That is, review the state of the art relevant to my thesis} ... {\tt What has been done so far on the problem?}
		\item Again, a different title is probably appropriate; e.g., ``State of the Art in Zylon Algorithms.'' 
		\item Determine a collection of seminal papers (fundamental references) that can be considered real milestones in the field of interest
		\item What are the seminal papers in this field, and for my research topic? Have I read, reviewed, and referenced them? % In psychology, read recent overview chapters, integrative articles, and recent research ... Integrative articles that draw upon diverse areas of the field and relate them to the whole.
		\item For my research topic, are there seminar classes offered by any university that provides a list of papers that I should read?
		\item What other issues are involved in this topic?
		\item Present (/perform critical analysis of) the major ideas in the state of the art right up to, but not including, my own personal brilliant ideas
		\item Organize this section by idea(s), and not by author or by publication.
		\item For example, if there have been three important main approaches to Zylon Algorithms to date, you might organize subsections around these three approaches, if necessary: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item 3.1 Iterative Approximation of Zylons
			\item 3.2 Statistical Weighting of Zylons
			\item 3.3 Graph-Theoretic Approaches to Zylon Manipulation
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Determine if related research might be published under different keywords
		\item The lit review can be difficult, and I may feel lost and don't know where I'm going. This is because I'm trying to do several things concurrently; I'm trying to learn about this whole field, and get a conceptual framework of how to map out this area of research. So, {Fight On!!!}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item {\bf \color{cyan} A very clear statement of the question is essential to proving that you have made an original and worthwhile contribution to knowledge. To prove the originality and value of your contribution, you must present a thorough review of the existing literature on the subject, and on closely related subjects. Then, by making direct reference to your literature review, you must demonstrate that your question (a) has not been previously answered, and (b) is worth answering. Describing how you answered the question is usually easier to write about, since you have been intimately involved in the details over the course of your graduate work. }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%	Project timeline, OR working plan / work schedule
\item Project timeline: work schedule (or working plan), with milestones (e.g., literature review, software implementation, software testing, tool analysis, and writing) and targets: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -3pt
	\item A deliverable is different from a project milestone in the sense that a milestone is a way of checking to what extent you are making progress to an outcome. A milestone can be completing the planning phase of the project while a deliverable includes things like design documents, testing scripts, requirement documents etc.
	\item indicate previous coursework and research experience that prepared me for research in this field
	\item indicate what will I do in preparation for Ph.D. research in the program, prior to its commencement; {\bf intern in a VLSI formal verification group (or another EDA group) at National Taiwan University? {\it Develop SMT solver {\bf TrojanSMT Lite}??? Develop tool for HWMCC???} Design Automation Summer School??? ARTIST Summer School in Europe 2009? Check if I can use research in this phase for my Ph.D. dissertation!!!}
	\item list specific milestones, and a timeline for when I expect to meet each milestone; the timeline should schedule writing up of results along the way, and indicate possible conferences or journals to which the work should be submitted 
	\item Completion of comprehensive literature review of my research problem
	\item Completion of each subproblem that will help me solve my research problem
	\item for each subproblem, include the following milestones/tasks: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -3pt
		\item brief literature review to keep myself to date with contemporary solutions to subproblem
		\item either select one of the best solution to implement, tweak the ``best'' existing solution, or develop a new solution
		\item the development of any solution shall include the following tasks: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item development of an algorithm or heuristic
			\item if an algorithm is developed, mathematically prove that it works; if necessary, use axioms lemmas ... Also, does this algorithm have any corollary?
			\item if a heuristic is developed, indicate if a metaheuristic is used; if so, which metaheuristic is used
			\end{enumerate}
		\item implementation of the solution
		\item verify, test, and validate the solution
		\item benchmark this solution
		\item analyze this solution and draw conclusions from my experimental results; this should also involve a statistical analysis of my experimental results
		\item write up my solution and findings in a technical report and/or conference paper; this shall form a section or chapter in my Ph.D. dissertation
		\end{enumerate}
	\item When developing and updating this timeline, for each task that I assume will take time {\it t} to complete, plan for a duration of 1.5$\times${\it t} to complete the task
	\item Course credits in {\bf ICT doctoral courses} to be completed: $\geq$15 in $1^{st}$ year, \& $\geq$9 in $2^{nd}$ year; $\geq$24 in the first two academic years
	\item Completion/Progress of classes that are required for the degree program
	\item Suggested timeframe for the {\bf qualifying examination (Quals)}
	\item Complete a draft of my Ph.D. thesis proposal by the end of my first year, get the draft reviewed before the 3rd week of the second year, make corrections to the proposal in the next fortnight, and repeat review-correct process (2 weeks for review, 2 weeks for correction) no more than thrice ... {\tt Else, it may be an indication that I would have chosen a bad research problem}
	\item Pass my qualifying examination before the $18^{th}$ month mark
	\item Pass my qualifying examination before I commence my first internship. This lifts a burden off me, and brings me closer towards graduation. It can also bring a focus to my research to a specialized (sub-)topic, and help me find an internship that better suits my research interests; if I can use work from my research internship for my thesis, this may allow me to knock of some milestones (solve some subproblems) and bring me closer to graduation.
	\item Tasks to work on for a thesis on SMT-based formal verification of MPSoCs: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item develop SMT solver {\bf TrentoSMT Lite}: develop parser for input boolean function of predicates, implement SAT solver engine, and develop output generator
		\item develop {\it tool} to transform a representation of a VLSI circuit into a boolean function of predicates (so that I can verify it with the SMT solver)

%		\item International Workshop on Software and Compilers for Embedded Systems (SCOPES 201X) -- Jun/Varies // The influence of embedded systems is constantly growing. Increasingly powerful and versatile devices are developed and put on the market at a fast pace. The number of features is increasing, and so are the constraints on the systems concerning size, performance, energy dissipation and timing predictability. Since most systems today use a processor to execute an application program rather than using dedicated hardware, the requirements can not be fulfilled by hardware architects alone: Hardware and software have to work together to meet the tight constraints put on modern devices.	...	One of the key characteristics of embedded software is that it heavily depends on the underlying hardware. The reason of the dependency is that embedded software needs to be designed in an application specific way. To reduce the system design cost, e.g. code size, energy consumption etc., embedded software needs to be optimized exploiting the characteristics of the underlying hardware.	...	SCOPES focuses on the software generation process for modern embedded systems. Topics of interest include all aspects of the compilation process, starting with suitable modeling and specification techniques and programming languages for embedded systems. The emphasis of the workshop lies on code generation techniques for embedded processors. The exploitation of specialized instruction set characteristics is as important as the development of new optimizations for embedded application domains. Cost criteria for the entire code generation and optimization process include runtime, timing predictability, energy dissipation, code size and others. Since today's embedded devices increasingly consist of a multi-processor system-on-chip, the scope of this workshop particularly covers compilation techniques for MPSoC architectures.	...	In addition, this workshop intends to put a spotlight on the interactions between compilers and other components in the embedded system design process. This includes compiler support for e.g. architecture exploration during HW/SW codesign or interactions between operating systems and compilation techniques. Finally, techniques for compiler aided profiling, measurement, debugging and validation of embedded software are also covered by this workshop, because stability of embedded software is mandatory ... code generation techniques for embedded processors ...

Stuff to consider when pursuing a degree program, and when selecting classes or specialization track (if any): \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -4pt
\item Take into account your interests and strengths
\item Theory versus programming/projects (practical work)

\label{questionsaboutphdprogramprofessoradministrator}

Questions to ask about the Ph.D. program (ask a professor or administrator): \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -4pt
\item Does this Ph.D. position include any teaching responsibilities? Or, do Ph.D. students have teaching responsibilities?
\item Quals (Qualifying Exam): Does the qualifying exam only include the research proposal? Do I also have to pass an oral examination and/or a written examination, which tests the breath and depth of my technical knowledge in my research topic? How many attempts am I allowed to have? Or rather, how many times can I attempt to take the qualifying exam?
\item Do I have to take the Italian intensive and extensive language courses under CIAL?
\item Can I do research overseas at Intel Haifa for two semesters, or Intel Haifa and CMU/Berkeley?
\item What is the grading policy for classes? What is the weightage for midterms (midterm examination), finals (final examination), term/research paper, papers, projects (presentations and reports) 
\item Does the university have a dead week, swotvac, or study days before finals? Reading week???
\item Does the uni/program have a finals week for Ph.D. students?
\item Does the university have a spring/fall recess, or spring/fall break?
\item The CS Ph.D. program at the University of Trento is a sandwich PhD program, which requires me to do an internship at a company or another academic institution
\item How can I get data on student outcomes such as internship placement, attrition rates, indebtedness and types of employment?
\item Can I complete all my coursework requirements in my first year? That is, can I take 24 course credits for ICT doctoral courses in my first year, and take no classes in my second and third years?
\item Can I take my quals in my first year?
\item What is the average number of Ph.D. graduates per year for this university? Remember USC confers $>$300 doctoral degrees in 2009, and Stanford conferred $\approx$700 (or about 670)

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Notes and Advice About Internships}
\label{adviceforinternships}

Notes and advice about internships: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item To deal with scheduling difficulties with internship supervisor/manager, try arranging weekly appointments and reschedule when necessary. Else, try phone meetings, or inform the internship director 
\item Attend meetings with an agenda, so that I can get what I want out of the meeting from the meeting
\item Do not fear about making mistakes, and being faulted
\item Do not be sidelined, and ignored by your supervisor/manager

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Notes And Advice For Being A Graduate Student}
\label{adviceforgradstudents}

Notes and advice for being a graduate student: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Don't treat my techniques as golden hammers. They can't save the world, and solve all of its problems.
\item Focus on my research and its originality. And, don't pick a mentor who bogs me down with too many courses, obligations, and prerequisites
\item Find what I am passionate about, and pursue it regardless of what others expect me to do. Don't try to be a clone of my mentor or anyone else, find my own unique path and passions
\item Once I identify my passion, and have a job consistent with it, work my butt off and produce, produce, produce.
\item Don't be bashful about what I have to offer as a research engineer/scientist -- I've had great training. 
\item Remember that I am more than my job; I don't live forever, so have some fun!
\item Find a mentor whose commitment is to my professional development, and who will help me achieve what I are interested in
\item Have a ``cuddle group'' -- a group of friends, colleagues, and classmates that can support me and who I can talk to about the challenges of being an intern, postdoc, or new faculty member or research engineer/scientist
\item Get involved in the community -- volunteer at a domestic violence shelter, or advocate for policies or laws that matter to me ... make a difference!
\item Always ask what is the main takeaway of this paper, report, thesis, or project.
\item Motivation: doing excellent research gives me a better chance to get a research position in industry, or get a tenure-track position in academia immediately after completing my Ph.D.; otherwise, I may have to settle for postdoc positions, and avoid being mired in postdoctoral research for too long (and the constant scramble for grant money) ... postdoc positions that require me to carry out too many duties can also be snares along the way
\item Establish a excellent research reputation (quality and quantity of publication record, and winning programming or IC design contests), and grant history to help me get a good research position after graduation
\item When I use \LaTeX\ to typeset any document, such as my dissertation or grant proposal, store each chapter/section/subsection of the document in a new file. This allows me to easily typeset only a chapter, section, or subsection of the document, and disseminate that chapter, section, or subsection to others for review. When people look at an individual chapter, section, or subsection, they may be more wiling to pay greater attention to the details and give me feedback on the document. Use these feedback when I update (correct and extend) my document
\item Read my manuscript aloud to peers or have them read it to me -- it's amazing what errors you'll catch
\item Attend as many research seminars and colloquiums/colloquia as I can
\item Determine who the authorities (compare with key opinion leaders / KOLs, or opinion leaders) are in my field, and what are its seminal publications (or seminal/classic papers). That is, who are the true leaders (experts) in my field? Which publications are highly influential in my field? Available online at: \url{http://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-the-seminal-papers-of-an-academic-field}; last accessed on September 25, 2010.
\item Use Web 2.0 technologies, such as {\it MyEdu} (\url{http://www.myedu.com/}), to select my classes, plan my class timetable, check my progress towards graduation, and organize my calendar.
\item Put videos of my talks at \url{http://videolectures.net/} or YouTube; e.g., I can put up videos of my talks at conferences, Quals, and my Ph.D. oral defense
\item Talk to rising seniors/juniors about research topics that fascinate them. I may get insights into research trajectories/topics that are relevant to my trajectory/topics, but am currently ignorant of. Do that for outstanding rising sophomores as well.
\item Do the heavy-lifting in my research: writing journal and conference papers, and software development.
\item Revise Q-Q plots, so that I can use Q-Q plots to compare SAT/SMT solvers and EDA tools with a given set of benchmarks. See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Q_plot}.
\item Some things to pay attention to: \vspace{-0.3cm}

\item {\bf Andrew Kahng}
\item ``Andrew Kahng--Crafting the Future of EDA,'' By Peggy Aycinena, in DACeZine, Volume 4, Issue 2, Oct 16, 2008: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item \url{http://www.dac.com/newsletter/shownewsletter.aspx?newsid=53}
	\item Initiatives such as OpenAccess, plus the fact that core synthesis, timing, global placement, sizing, etc. technologies are getting long in the tooth, mean that many genies are out of the bottle and easier to match or improve on. So, new EDA companies can become serious players very fast -- for instance, Atoptech in the back end -- and it is easier than ever for customers to switch vendors in and out.
	\item With so much focus on polishing or re-implementing the current scope of ``cash cow'' subflows, not only does the EDA market fail to grow in system-level or die-package or embedded software or analog/mixed-signal design areas, but existing technologies become ever more commoditized and interchangeable.
	\item The big vendors have not figured out how to grab that big brass ring of royalty-based revenue -- although a couple of smaller vendors have -- so EDA remains a rental (and, service) business.
	\item If weÕre going to solve the ESL, embedded software, multicore, analog, DFM, etc. challenges, we have to move beyond yet another SPICE parser, yet another shapes database, yet another back-end data model, and so on. Interoperability has proven impossible to incent, so perhaps customers must collectively create their own EDA development entity that generates and supports production-worthy infrastructure, to which EDA vendors can plug in or snap on.
	\item Will EDA companies ever improve their understanding of electronic system design, the chip design process, and software quality, so as to merit ``partner'' rather than ``supplier'' standing in the semiconductor supply chain?
	\item {\bf ``It's an old rant of mine is that tools shouldn't just be gigantic Swiss army knives. They must actively comprehend and define methodologies.''}
	\item most exciting growth areas going forward for young researchers in EDA: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item ``Multicore! System architectures, how to design them, how to program them, etc. These issues will continue to bring challenges for many, many years to come.  And, any list of buzz-phrases has to include system-level optimization, enablement of embedded software design, and verification.''
		\item ``Plus, we still require a science of design up through the system scale.  EDA has been an incredible m{\'{e}}lange of device physics, graph algorithms, heuristic optimization, computer and network architecture, etc.  Its culture is largely one of incremental improvement of point optimizations, without much global design context. We need better frameworks and we need better experimental and evaluation methodologies!''
		\item non-traditional technologies for computing still demand research on feasibility -- which requires design and optimization -- as well as scalable manufacturing
		\end{enumerate}
	\item advice for new grad students: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item My generic advice to students is to de-specialize! To be creative and aware, to learn physics, chemistry or biology -- and, optimization -- to learn how to program parallel and heterogeneous systems, and to always understand the context for what you do, and why you do it.
		\item If I were going to grad school today -- beyond depth in some research focus, I would seek breadth, breadth, and more breadth -- not just in CAD and VLSI, but allied areas as well.  
		\item The world will always need better and broader connections between the science or art of design and the underlying technology options and application needs.  Hugo De Man, in his memorable DAC 2000 keynote address, explained to us what a 21st-century design engineer should be able to do. Reference: Hugo De Man, ``System Design Challenges in the Post-PC Era,'' Keynote address, $37^{th}$ ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference, Los Angeles, June 2000.
		\item Around that time, my friend Ranko Scepanovic was telling me how he was working on ``from C to OPC.'' It would have been great to have perfected such a toolkit during graduate school rather than piecing it together afterward.
		\item Of course, all graduate students need to work on their abilities to: 1) see big pictures and their choke points; 2) create practically relevant abstractions and problem formulations; and 3) innovate and validate impactful solutions to these problems.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item ``Given the massive changes in the geo-political and geo-economic landscape, do you see the geographic focus for cutting-edge CAD tool work remaining here in North America for the foreseeable future? If not, where has it moved to, or will it move to?'' -- Peggy Aycinena: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item ``I think we will inevitably see multiple foci, colored by regional investment: the EU and system-level design; migration of semiconductor production to Asia; migration of chip implementation services to India and China; etc. WeÕll also see other factors at work, such as the macro trends and crossroads we were discussing earlier.'' -- Andrew Kahng
		\item ``One example of a non-U.S. focal point: Taiwan. Taiwan schools are very strong in the CADathlon held at ICCAD each year. They win the placement and global routing contests at ISPD. And, they can be expected to do very strong research in areas such as DFM. On the commercial side, we see the rapidly increasing visibility of SpringSoft.'' -- Andrew Kahng
		\item ``I believe, and I hope, that the U.S. university system and the continued attractiveness of North American schools to students from China, Korea, etc. will help keep the largest focal point here for a long time. But as you and I once discussed in an earlier conversation about `brain drains,' I think we are seeing that flows of engineering talent in general, and CAD tool innovation specifically, are starting to move away from the U.S.'' -- Andrew Kahng
		\end{enumerate}
	\item The world is evolving so quickly in so many ways. We see an unprecedented global economic context, consolidation of technologies and businesses, emergence of new product classes and markets, massive shifts toward cleantech and health/bio -- kind of a hurricane of macrotrends. But at the eye of this hurricane, more than ever before, our economic and societal health depends on technology agility and a continuing stream of innovative semiconductor-based products that bring compelling benefit to mankind (and, compelling value to consumers). To this end, I believe that EDA serves as a nexus that joins the product markets and driving applications, the designers, the semiconductor and packaging technologies, and the mathematical, engineering and algorithmic foundations of IC CAD. And in this context, we need DAC to be a heartbeat not only for the EDA industry and its users, but for the broader design chain as well.

Indeed, {\bf \color{blue} there has been many a summertime when I worked longer hours on harder problems but without the comic relief of faculty meetings}.''
	\item ``When I was in graduate school in Urbana, Illinois, where I had my first real taste of academic freedom, summers initially meant studying foreign languages to satisfy requirements that are now as rare as prices in textbook catalogs. Whereas during the fall and spring semesters I took all of my classes on the engineering end of campus, during the summer I trekked beyond the student union to where French and German were taught -- in buildings that housed not laboratories but theaters.''
	\item ``For those of us teaching assistants who were fortunate enough to pass the translation tests, summers next came to mean concentrated work on a research project. {\bf \color{blue} It was here that I first learned what it meant to live and breathe a problem daily -- and dream of its solution nightly -- without the benefit of an answer key, instructorÕs manual, or expert to consult. Now we students were expected to be the experts to whom others would come regarding the slice of engineering science that we had carved out for ourselves.}''
	\item {\bf \color{blue} ``I lived and breathed a problem by day, dreamt a solution by night.''}
	\item {\bf \color{blue} ``The loneliness of the long-distance runner has been written about, but little has been said about the loneliness of the long-suffering doctoral student. Day after day and night after night, we worked away on problems whose solution seemed then even more elusive than a balanced checkbook. Summer was a time to make progress on a problem that would define us, at least for a while, but progress came slowly and sullenly.''}
	\item {\bf \color{blue} ``With the end of my research in sight, summer came to mean the time to write up the dissertation and also write up papers based on it. I had a sense of urgency to submit my first paper before someone else might submit something similar enough to make all of my work null and void. After all, what I was working on was pushing the frontier of my field, something other graduate students were doing also. And the field was somewhat crowded.''}
	\item ``{\bf \color{blue} Becoming young faculty members brought new summer pressures, at first mostly centered on writing proposals for research extending our dissertation work. Soon, we were advised to break away from that and come up with fresh ideas.} When we were fortunate enough to get some of those funded, summer was often the time of year when the serious research promised in the proposals had to be done.''
	\item {\bf \color{blue} ``Summer also is, or should be, a time for reflection. Where have we been and where are we going, not only with our research but also with our teaching? Summer is a time to take stock and, on the eve of the new academic year, to make resolutions.''}
	\item ``Nonacademic friends and relatives envy us our `summers off,' but that's probably because they do not appreciate how busy our summers actually are. And they are short, as we realize in early August, when the new semester looms like a massive homework assignment. There are syllabi to organize and lectures to prepare. Little time is left for doing research or writing up results. That has to wait for next summer.''

	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item \url{http://www.dac.com/newsletter/shownewsletter.aspx?newsid=64}
	\item For an engineer, the basic skill that needs to be mastered is problem solving. Take a physical problem, abstract it as a mathematical model, solve the abstraction, and map it back to reality. A really good abstraction achieves the necessary balance between the realism of the model and the tractability of the abstracted problem. Of course, this isnÕt just an EDA concept -- itÕs true of most areas of engineering, and this is what I urge my students to learn. The rest of what should be considered revolves around the technology itself -- something thatÕs critically important to comprehend, but is ever changing. I emphasize to my students that 10 years from today, they will be working on a completely different area than their current research, and they must learn the skills that make them adaptable.
	\item IÕve found the students who do work in this area to be highly motivated. EDA has always been a rich source of solution techniques that have made a broader impact -- think BDDs, verification, model-order reduction, and so on. Our problems are large in size, challenging in nature, and require great ingenuity to solve. This isnÕt going to change anytime soon!

		\item follow the rules, such as formatting guidelines
		\item take the advice: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item if my application is returned with suggestions to revise it, follow reviewers' advice
			\item my reviewers will highlight strengths and areas for improvement, so when I resubmit my grant, make sure the areas for improvement have become strengths
			\item that doesn't mean I have to agree with everything the reviewers say, but I must clearly articulate in my revision why I disagree
			\end{enumerate}
		\item market my plan: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item make my message very clear in a way that helps them learn why my project is so important
			\item at the same time, don't brag or otherwise sell myself too aggressively
			\item I want to present myself as a thoughtful, serious fellow scientist
			\end{enumerate}
		\item be realistic: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item reviewers frequently critique young researchers' proposals for being overly ambitious
			\item my research plan should be conceptually tight, be well-linked to the literature, have clearly articulated hypotheses, and allow me to answer the questions the research hypotheses raise
			\item my proposal should be airtight, anticipating any questions the reviewer might have about decisions I made in designing my study
			\item reviewers are looking not just for the quality of research, but also at the quality of the applicant -- the way I think and the way I work
			\end{enumerate}
		\item persist: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item the advice ``Never give up; never surrender!'' applies to every phase of the grant application process, whether it's enlisting others' help, crafting my grant, or revising my proposal.
			\item do not be discouraged if my application is sent back for a rewrite: It is extremely common for grants to get accepted on the second or third round
			\item many applicants who apply for F31s research grants, and have to revise them end up securing them
			\item if I plan to garner research funds as my career goes on, I'll likely be doing plenty of rewriting and resubmitting

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Advice for Teaching Assistants (TAs)}
\label{adviceforteachingassistants}

Advice for graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), or simply TAs: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Prepare for the classes with ample time to spare; prepare early, and know my stuff well ... if I don't know my stuff well, my students can/will assume that I do not know what I'm doing, and they'll not pay attention to the discussion session that I am leading ... think of the poor, inept TAs that I had
\item Talk to TAs and faculty who have taught the same course that I will teach, and ask them for copies of their syllabi
\item Sit in on the class that I'm going to teach
\item Find out which faculty in the department are known for being good teachers, and ask them if I can watch them teach
\item Attend conference workshops and seminars, and my department's formal GTA programs ... such as a three-day teaching orientation before the school year begins
\item Observe other GTAs teaching
\item Know my job requirements, and expectations from the course instructor and/or fellow TAs ... For example, do I have to come to class occasionally and record grades? Do I have to grade a hundred term papers and answer students' e-mails?How much time per week am I expected to work?
\item Structure weekly or biweekly meetings where I can talk with the professor about student considerations, and how I think the class is responding to the teacher overall
\item Budget time into my schedule to complete my teaching tasks
\item New TAs often underestimate how long it takes to design and grade tests, or answer student questions
\item Develop an organization system that works for me and stick with it: use \LaTeX to typeset (lecture/study/class) notes, presentation slides, assignments (homework handouts), project descriptions, and examinations.
\item Pay attention to student epistemologies: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Some students (such as myself) learn just enough material and practice problems repetitively to get by in their engineering degree program without having a sound understanding of the fundamentals in science (including computer science) and mathematics.
	\item That is, students may favor descriptive knowledge (also known as declarative knowledge or propositional knowledge) without having a deep understanding of the fundamentals in science (including CS) and mathematics.
	\item Hence, I need to develop ways to help students (including myself) to acquire a deep understanding of the fundamentals in science (including CS) and mathematics.

Notes on EDA software development: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
% software environment
\item {\bf Software Environment}
\item do not spend too much time setting up the software development environment: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item if so-called ``better'' software engineering tools for build automation, configuration management, documentation generation, and automated regression testing take a long time to set up, use substitute tools that are easier to learn and use
	\item When I have free time later, I can learn how to use them and integrate them into my software development environment
	\item See \S\ref{envforswdevnvlsidesign}. {\bf Seriously, don't bother with all the fancy stuff until I have a significant code base.}
	\item {\bf Remember what Alicia Lowery said. ``Don't spend so much time automating stuff, such that you hardly have time for what you're supposed to do''}
	\end{enumerate}
\item do not spend too much time on setting up experimental environments to the detriment of spending time on innovating: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item focus on advancing state-of-the-art in evaluation methodologies to off-load ourselves to be more innovative
	\end{enumerate}
\item avoid vendor lock-in: use free and open-source software as far as possible; and choose proprietary software that uses open standards and file formats, rather than those that don't
\\ \rule{6in}{.1pt}
% computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools
\item {\bf Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) Tools}
\item configuration management tools
\item data modeling tools
\item model transformation tools
\item refactoring tools/browsers: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item \colorbox{yellow}{\bf Learn to use refactoring tools!!!}
	\item techniques that allow for more abstraction: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Encapsulate Field (field encapsulation, or data hiding) -- force code to access the field with getter and setter methods
		\item Generalize Type (type generalization) -- create more general types to allow for more code sharing
		\item Replace type -- checking code with State/Strategy
		\item Replace conditional with polymorphism
		\end{enumerate}
	\item techniques for breaking code apart into more logical pieces: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Extract Method, to turn part of a larger method into a new method. By breaking down code in smaller pieces, it is more easily understandable. This is also applicable to functions.
		\item Extract Class moves part of the code from an existing class into a new class.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item techniques for improving names and location of code: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Move Method or Move Field -- move to a more appropriate Class or source file
		\item Rename Method or Rename Field - changing the name into a new one that better reveals its purpose
		\item Pull Up -- in OOP, move to a superclass
		\item Push Down -- in OOP, move to a subclass
		\item Shotgun surgery -- in OOP, when a single change affects many classes. In this case, all affected code is kept in a single class, so that the change is made only in one place.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item avoid ``cut and paste coding''
	\item \colorbox{yellow}{\bf beware of technical debt (or design debt or code debt)}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item building up technical/design debt by not refactoring regularly would eventually force a rewrite of the software, which would consume much more time than regularly refactoring the software
		\item as technical/design debt accumulates, the software architecture tends toward a big ball of mud (no distinguishable software architecture); regular refactoring of the code can avoid this
		\item avoid these: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item spaghetti code: source code that has a complex and tangled control structure, especially one using many GOTOs, exceptions, threads, or other ``unstructured'' branching constructs
			\item ravioli code: a type of computer program structure, characterized by a number of small and (ideally) loosely-coupled software components
			\item lasagna code: a type of program structure, characterized by several well-defined and separable layers, where each layer of code accesses services in the layers below through well-defined interfaces
			\end{enumerate}

\item source code generation tools
\item Unified Modeling Language modeling tools: \vspace{-0.3cm}

\item 3 categories of CASE tools: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item tools support only specific tasks in the software process
	\item workbenches support only one or a few activities
	\item environments support (a large part of) the software process
	\item {\it workbenches and environments are generally built as collections of tools}

		\item CM tool is used to manage the {\bf code base}
		\item carry out {\tt continuous integration} to reduce integration times; that is, by reducing the changes/differences between the repository code and the developer's copy (of the repository), the amount of work required by the developer prior to the submission of their own changes is smaller; hence, continuous integration is used to avoid ``integration hell,'' where the aforementioned difference is huge; try, ``nightly builds,'' or submit a revision/build every couple of hours (prior to lunch/dinner/sleep); {\bf Automated Continuous Integration}
		\item advantages of continuous integration: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item when unit tests fail, or a bug is discovered, developers might revert the codebase back to a bug-free state, without wasting time debugging
			\item integration problems are detected and fixed continuously -- no last minute hiatus before release dates
			\item early warning of broken/incompatible code
			\item early warning of conflicting changes
			\item immediate unit testing of all changes
			\item constant availability of a ``current'' build for testing, demo, or release purposes
			\item the immediate impact of checking in incomplete or broken code acts as an incentive to developers to learn to work more incrementally with shorter feedback cycles

		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item {\bf User events:} Tracks the exact time of user interactions, such as mouse clicks.
		\item {\bf CPU and processes:} Monitors activity, sampling, load graphs, and threads.
		\item {\bf Memory:} Tracks garbage collection, object allocations, and leaks.
		\item {\bf File activity:} Monitors disk activity, reads and writes, and file locks.
		\item {\bf Network activity:} Measures and records network traffic.
		\item {\bf Graphics:} Interprets the inner workings of the {\tt OpenGL} driver.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Tracks that track: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Now you can visually compare many analysis instruments side by side over time.
		\item ThatÕs because {\tt Instruments} creates a time-based record of your entire application run, storing information such as CPU load, network and file activity, and memory allocations as separate ÒtracksÓ of data.
		\item These tracks are displayed synchronized over time, allowing you to quickly identify application events -- like what was happening with the disk just before the CPU usage spiked.
		\item {\tt Instruments} gives you a complete picture of your application, so you can better understand cause-and-effect relationships and make changes to improve performance. 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Record, replay, repeat: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Instruments works with new {\tt Universal Access features} in {\tt Leopard} to record a user-interactive run of your application, making it easy to replay the same behavior over and over.
		\item That way, you can create ad hoc application tests anytime you like.
		\item Record the applicationÕs behavior in {\tt Instruments}, change your code, and rerun the tests to see the effect of your changes.
		\item Run your application in a template and {\tt Instruments} visually compares the runs side by side, making it clear where your code changes affect performance or memory consumption.
		\end{enumerate}

	\item artifacts of the software testing process (testing artifacts): \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Test case: A test case in software engineering normally consists of a unique identifier, requirement references from a design specification, preconditions, events, a series of steps (also known as actions) to follow, input, output, expected result (postcondition), and actual result.
		\item Test script: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item a set of instructions that will be performed on the system under test to test that the system functions as expected
			\item the test script is the combination of a test case, test procedure, and test data
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Test data: Multiple sets of values or data are used to test the same functionality of a particular feature. All the test values and changeable environmental components are collected in separate files and stored as test data.
		\item Test suite: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item a collection of test cases that are intended to be used to test a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviours
			\item contains detailed instructions or goals for each collection of test cases, and information on the system configuration to be used during testing
			\item executable test suite: test suite integrated with test harness
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Test plan: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item {\bf it documents the strategy that will be used to verify and ensure that a product or system meets its design specifications and other requirements}
			\item a test specification that lets the developers (dev) know what test cases will be used by the software quality assurance (QA) team
			\item a systematic approach to testing a system, such as a machine or software
			\item the plan typically contains a detailed understanding of what the eventual workflow will be
			\item it includes one or more of the following: \vspace{-0.2cm}
				\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
				\item Design Verification, or Compliance test: to be performed during the development or approval stages of the product, typically on a small sample of units
				\item Manufacturing/Production test: to be performed during preparation or assembly of the product in an ongoing manner for purposes of performance verification and quality control
				\item Acceptance/Commissioning test: to be performed at the time of delivery or installation of the product
				\item Service and Repair test: to be performed as required over the service life of the product
				\item Regression test: to be performed on an existing operational product, to verify that existing functionality didn't get broken when other aspects of the environment are changed (e.g., upgrading the platform on which an existing application runs)
				\end{itemize}
			\item three major elements of a test strategy, which should be described in the test plan: \vspace{-0.2cm}
				\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
				\item Test Coverage: \vspace{-0.2cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item states what requirements will be verified during each stage of the product life
					\item derive test coverage from design specifications and other requirements, such as safety standards or regulatory codes
					\item each requirement or specification of the design would have one or more corresponding means of verification
					\item test coverage for different product life stages may overlap
					\item test coverage also feeds back into the design process, since the product may have to be designed to allow test access; see Design For Testability (DFT)
					\end{itemize}
				\item Test Methods: \vspace{-0.2cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item they state how test coverage will be implemented
					\item they may be determined by standards, regulatory agencies, or contractual agreement, or created ad hoc
					\item they also specify test equipment to be used in the performance of the tests and establish pass/fail criteria
					\item test methods used to verify hardware design requirements can range from very simple steps, such as visual inspection, to elaborate test procedures that are documented separately
					\end{itemize}
				\item Test Responsibilities: \vspace{-0.2cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item include what organizations will perform the test methods, and at each stage of the product life
					\item allow test organizations to plan, acquire, or develop test equipment and other resources necessary to implement the test methods for which they are responsible
					\item indicate what data will be collected, and how that data will be stored and reported (often referred to as ``deliverables'')
					\item one outcome of a successful test plan should be a record or report of the verification of all design specifications and requirements as agreed upon by all parties
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate} 
		\item Test harness: The software, tools, samples of data input and output, and configurations
		\item Traceability matrix: A table that correlates requirements (or design documents) to test documents. It is used to change tests when the source documents are changed, or to verify that the test results are correct.
		\item Testbed: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item A platform for experimentation for large development projects.
			\item Testbeds allow for rigorous, transparent and replicable testing of scientific theories, computational tools, and other new technologies.
			\item A sandbox is a testing (or virtual) environment that isolates untested code changes and experimentation from the production environment or repository, in the context of software development including Web development and revision control, and by extension in web-based editing environments including wikis.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Test oracle: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item a mechanism used to determine whether a test has passed or failed
			\item to determine whether the software passes the test case for input(s) of a given test case, it compares the output(s) of the system under test to the expected output(s)
			\item oracles are always separate from the system under test
			\item common oracles include: \vspace{-0.2cm}
				\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
				\item specifications and documentation
				\item a substitute software for carrying out the same function, while using different algorithm(s) and heuristic(s)
				\item 
				\end{itemize}
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item phases in a software testing cycle: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item requirements analysis and design phase: QA team work with developers in determining what aspects of a design are testable, and the required parameters for those tests to work
		\item test planning: test strategy, test plan, and testbed creation
		\item test development: test procedures, test scenarios, test cases, test datasets, and test scripts
		\item test execution: QA team execute/run the software based on the test plan, and carry out bug reporting (and/or feature request -- missing feature?)
		\item test reporting: provide test reports on the test effort, and indicate whether the software is ready for release based on selected metrics indicated in the test plan
		\item test result analysis, or defect analysis: the development team and the users decide what defects should be treated, fixed, rejected (i.e., false positive), or deferred (with respect to making a decision)
		\item retesting the resolved defects: once a defect has been dealt with by the development team, it is retested by the testing team
		\item regression testing: it is common to have a small test program built of a subset of tests, for each integration of new, modified or fixed software, in order to ensure that the latest delivery has not ruined anything, and that the software product as a whole is still working correctly
		\item test closure: once the test meets the exit criteria, the activities such as capturing the key outputs, lessons learned, results, logs, and documents related to the project are archived and used as a reference for future projects
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Scenario testing uses scenario tests (or scenarios) that are based on a hypothetical story to help a person think through a complex problem or system for a testing environment: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item The ideal scenario has five key characteristics: it is: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item a story that is
			\item motivating
			\item credible
			\item complex, and
			\item easy to evaluate
			\end{enumerate}
		\item These tests are usually different from test cases; test cases cover a single step, whereas scenarios cover a number of steps
		\item Test suites and scenarios can be used together for complete system testing
		\end{enumerate}
	\item All-pairs testing or pairwise testing is a combinatorial software testing method that, for each pair of input parameters to a system (typically, a software algorithm), tests all possible discrete combinations of those parameters. Using carefully chosen test vectors, this can be done much faster than an exhaustive search of all combinations of all parameters, by ``parallelizing'' the tests of parameter pairs. The number of tests is typically {\it O(nm)}, where n and m are the number of possibilities for each of the two parameters with the most choices.
	\end{enumerate}

		\item defect prevention process: identify and remove process inadequacies that encourage defects
		\item Early and frequent reviews of small work samples can identify systematic errors in the authors' work processes, which can be corrected before further erroneous work is done.

	\item ``a team of qualified personnel ... examines the suitability of the software product for its intended use and identifies discrepancies from specifications and standards. Technical reviews may also provide recommendations of alternatives and examination of various alternatives''
	\item ``A code review can be done as a special kind of inspection in which the team examines a sample of code and fixes any defects in it. In a code review, a defect is a block of code which does not properly implement its requirements, which does not function as the programmer intended, or which is not incorrect but could be improved (for example, it could be made more readable or its performance could be improved). In addition to helping teams find and fix bugs, code reviews are useful for both cross-training programmers on the code being reviewed and for helping junior developers learn new programming techniques.''
	\item ``The goal of the inspection is to identify defects''
	\item ``The purpose of a technical review is to arrive at a technically superior version of the work product reviewed, whether by correction of defects or by recommendation or introduction of alternative approaches. While the latter aspect may offer facilities that software inspection lacks, there may be a penalty in time lost to technical discussions or disputes which may be beyond the capacity of some participants.''

%	For my BibTeX database, use: coding scheme, coding standards, coding styles, coding guidelines, and programming style
\item {\bf Coding Standards, Code Documentation Guidelines, and Coding Style Guide}
\item Documentation generators that I am using: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Doxygen (for C++, C, Java, Python, Fortran, and VHDL)
	\item DOC++ (for C/C++ and Java)
	\item ROBODoc (for Ruby)
	\item RDoc (for Ruby)
	\item Sphinx (for Python): \url{http://sphinx.pocoo.org/}
	\item Javadoc (for Java)
	\item Haddock (for Haskell)
	\item DocBook (semantic markup language) that can produce documents in various formats. {\bf Note: I am not sure if it can parse source code, and churn out the appropriate documentation (e.g., API) in PDF, as man pages, and in HTML. While I can use it for documentation of my projects, I may as well use \LaTeX\ since I would have to use \LaTeX\ for my research publications anyway.}
	\end{enumerate}
\item My coding style should follow that of {\tt Javadoc}, which is similar to that used by Doxygen. My indent style would be the {\tt 1TBS} variant of the {\tt K\&R} style, which is an abbreviation of ``{\tt The One True Brace Style}''. It is also equivalent to the {\tt Kernel Normal Form style} (or {\tt BSD KNF style}).
\item Tags that I would use in my comments are: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item @author {\it Author's\_Name}: indicate the author ({\it Author's\_Name}) of the file/function
	\item @version {\it X.Y}: indicate the version ({\it X.Y}) of the file
	\item @section {\it SECTION\_NAME}: indicate the section ({\it SECTION\_NAME}) of the file, which can be: {\it LICENSE} or {\it DESCRIPTION}
	\item @param {\it x}: indicate the parameter ({\it x}) of the constructor or function
	\item @exception {\it Exception\_Name}, or @throws {\it Exception\_Name}: an exception that a function/method can throw
	\item @return {\it Return\_Statement}: indicate the return (type and) action of the function
	\item @see {\it reference}: a link to another element in the documentation; e.g., @see {\it Class\_Name}, or @see {\it Class\_Name\#member\_function\_name}
	\item @since {\it X.Y: Month-Day-Year}: This functionality has been added since version {\it X.Y} (and on the date {\it Month-Day-Year})
	\item @deprecated {\it description}: Describe an outdated function/method, and indicate when the function/method has deprecated
	\item ``@link {\it ... URL...} @endlink'' is used to include hyperlinks in the generated documentation for Doxygen
	\item \#\#\#\# IMPORTANT NOTES: Notes that are critical for helping the reader understanding assumptions and decisions made while developing the software
	\item @todo($<$message$>$, $<$version$>$) (or \#\#\#\# TO BE COMPLETED): Task to be finished at a later time
	\item \#\#\#\# TO BE FIXED: Task to be debugged at a later time
	\item @migration($<$message$>$, $<$version$>$): Code is being migrated to another function/method, or class.
	\item See \url{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html} for more information of tags that are recognized by {\tt Doxygen}.
	\item @pre (or @precondition): Precondition(s) of the function.
	\item @assert: Assertion(s) of the function.
	\item @post (or @postcondition): Postcondition(s) of the function.
	\end{enumerate}
\item The order of tags in different sections of the code is given as follows: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Headers/Interfaces and Classes: @version, @author, and @see
	\item Constructors: @param, @exception, and @see
	\item Functions/Methods: @param, @return, @exception, and @see
	\item Variables can use the @see tags.
	\item The @deprecated tag can be used for headers/interfaces, classes, constructors, functions/methods, and variables.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Since I am using Doxygen for generating documentation, I can use \LaTeX\ to provide richer markup.
\item Use {\tt ROBODoc} and {\tt RDoc} for {\tt Ruby}, and the latter for {\tt Tcl} and {\tt Perl}. The latter also generates documentation in \LaTeX, {\tt HTML}, and {\tt UNIX man pages}.
\item For a suggested coding style for {\tt Python} scripts, see \url{http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/}.

% hybrid software involving multiple computer languages, such as a programming language (C++) and a scripting language (Python)
\item {\bf Hybrid Software Involving Multiple Computer Languages}
\item use the {\tt Swig} software tool and/or the {\tt Boost Python} {\tt C++} library to integrate {\tt C++} and {\tt Python} code, and to provide seamless operability between them
\item {\tt C++/Tcl} is a software programming library interface which allows the integration of {\tt C++} into {\tt Tcl} and vice versa: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item the {\tt C++/Tcl} library offers the following features: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Support for both extending {\tt Tcl} with {\tt C++} modules and embedding {\tt Tcl} in {\tt C++} applications
		\item Possibility to expose free {\tt C++} functions as commands in {\tt Tcl}
		\item Possibility to define classes and class member functions, visible in {\tt Tcl} in the style similar to {\tt SWIG} wrappers
		\item Possibility to manipulate {\tt Tcl} lists and objects from the {\tt C++} code
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item {\tt Tcl/Java} is a project to bridge {\tt Tcl} and {\tt Java}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item The {\tt Tcl/Java} project's goal is to make integrating the {\tt Java} platform and the {\tt Tcl} scripting language as easy as possible
	\item {\tt Tcl/Java} consists of two packages, {\tt Jacl} and {\tt Tcl Blend}
	\item {\tt Jacl}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item a {\tt Tcl} interpreter that is written in {\tt Java}
		\item a self-contained implementation of a {\tt Tcl} interpreter, written entirely in {\tt Java}
		\item run {\tt Tcl} within the {\tt JVM}
		\item {\tt Jacl} also includes features that facilitate communication between a {\tt Java} interpreter and a {\tt Tcl} interpreter
		\item {\tt Jacl} is typically used to incorporate scripting functionality into an existing {\tt Java} application
		\item doesn't require the user to deal with the complexities of native code that come with {\tt Tcl Blend}
		\item {\bf Jacl} is used to integrate {\bf Tcl} scripts into {\bf Java} applications
		\end{enumerate}
	\item {\tt Tclblend}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item call {\tt Java} class libraries from the {\tt C} runtime using {\tt JNI} and an embedded {\tt JVM}
		\item {\tt Tcl Blend} is a {\tt Tcl} extension that makes use of {\tt JNI} to facilitate communication between a {\tt Java} interpreter and a {\tt Tcl} interpreter
		\item {\tt Tcl Blend} is typically used to load a {\tt Java} interpreter into an existing {\tt Tcl} process, so that functionality implemented in {\tt Java} can be accessed via {\tt Tcl}
		\item One can also load {\tt Tcl Blend} and {\tt Tcl} into a {\tt Java} process, which is a great way to add scripting functionality to an existing {\tt Java} application
		\item Because {\tt Tcl Blend} is a normal {\tt Tcl} extension, one can use it with other popular {\tt Tcl} extensions like {\tt Tk}, {\tt Expect}, and {\tt Itcl}
		\item {\bf {\bf Tcl Blend} is used to call/invoke {\bf Java} methods on {\bf Java} objects that are allocated in {\bf Tcl} scripts}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item {\tt Tcl Blend} and {\tt Jacl} define both a {\tt Tcl} API and a {\tt Java} API that make it easy to call {\tt Java} code from {\tt Tcl} or call {\tt Tcl} code from {\tt Java}
	\item For example, one could allocate a {\tt Java} object in a {\tt Tcl} script and interactively invoke {\tt Java} methods on the object
	\item It is also easy to use the supplied API to evaluate a {\tt Tcl} procedure from a {\tt Java} method or implement {\tt Tcl} procudures in {\tt Java}
	\item The flexible API and wealth of implementation options provided by the {\tt Tcl/Java} project make integrating {\tt Tcl} and {\tt Java} easy

	\item options for multicore include {\tt IBM}'s {\tt Cell BE}
	\item ``the typical barrier to adopting GPUs is simple, you have to re-write your code''
	\item however, as multi-/many-core processors scale in terms of the number of processor cores, software that run on such multiprocessors need to be rewritten to keep each core busy
	\item note that rewriting code can be very costly in terms of time
	\item rewriting code for GPGPU computing or multi-/many-core processors probably requires software refactoring of the EDA software architecture
	\item explore the benefits of GPGPU computing vs those of multi-/many-core processors the way a software architect would

	\item {\tt Motif}; see \url{http://www.openmotif.org/} and \url{http://www.opengroup.org/motif/} --- I do not prefer to use {\tt Motif} because GUI development with {\tt Motif} requires a decent, if not good, Motif GUI IDE. An example of a decent Motif GUI Builder would be the proprietary X-Designer.

	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item object-oriented design (including architectural patterns???)
	\item architectural design: architectural patterns: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Architectural patterns are software patterns that offer well-established solutions to architectural problems in software engineering.
		\item It gives description of the elements and relation type together with a set of constraints on how they may be used.
		\item An architectural pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization schema for a software system, which consists of subsystems, their responsibilities and interrelations.
		\item In comparison to design patterns, architectural patterns are larger in scale.
		\item Even though an architectural pattern conveys an image of a system, it is not an architecture as such.
		\item An architectural pattern is rather a concept that captures essential elements of a software architecture.
		\item Countless different architectures may implement the same pattern and thereby share the same characteristics.
		\item Furthermore, patterns are often defined as something ``strictly described and commonly available''.
		\item One of the most important aspects of architectural patterns is that they embody different quality attributes. For example, some patterns represent solutions to performance problems and others can be used successfully in high-availability systems. In the early design phase, a software architect makes a choice of which architectural pattern(s) best provide the system's desired qualities.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item fundamental patterns
	\item creational patterns: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item These patterns have to do with class instantiation.
		\item They can be further divided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
		\item While class-creation patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process, object-creation patterns use delegation to get the job done.
		\item creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms to avoid design problems or added design complexity during object creation
		\end{enumerate}
	\item structural patterns: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item These concern class and object composition.
		\item They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
		\item structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities
		\end{enumerate}
	\item behavioral patterns: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Most of these design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.

		\item deliver working software frequently: the frequency can range in the order of several weeks/months; preferences are given to the shorter time scale (Timeboxing)
		\item working software: the primary measure of progress
		\item global awareness: At any point, any member of the team must be able to measure the teamÕs progress towards the customerÕs objectives and the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

\item {\bf Guidelines for Algorithm Design}
\item Whenever you are asked to design a new algorithm, there are a number of things you should do. This document itemizes your responsibilities as an algorithm designer. In particular, you are expected to do each of the following tasks whenever writing up a solution to design problem in CMSC-441 or CMSC-641: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Give your algorithm a name.
	\item State the input/output specifications of the algorithm.
	\item Write your algorithm in clear HIGH-LEVEL pseudocode. Your pseudocode should be detailed enough that a programmer could easily translate it into a high-level programming language; however, your pseudocode should not be so detailed as to look like low-level C code. Write your code as clearly and in as high a level as possible.
	\item Briefly and intuitively explain how your algorithm works. State the design strategy; do not explain your pseudocode line-by-line.
	\item Prove that your algorithm works correctly.
	\item State and prove the resource usage of your algorithm, including its running time and memory usage.
	\item State and prove any significant special properties of your algorithm.
	\item Extra notes: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Justify the steps/approach of my algorithm. Why did I do that? How is this beneficial?
		\item Elementary steps should be used in the pseudocode. Complex sequences of elementary steps should be wrapped as functional calls.
		\item Describe unambiguously each procedure with a finite number of steps to solve my research problems.
		\item Use examples to adequately explain my proposed techniques.

\item never ever knowingly join a death march project: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item In the software development and software engineering industries, a death march is a dysphemism for a project that is destined to fail.
	\item Usually it is a result of unrealistic or overly optimistic expectations in scheduling, feature scope, or both, and often includes lack of appropriate documentation, or any sort of relevant training.
	\item The knowledge of the doomed nature of the project weighs heavily on the psyche of its participants, as if they are helplessly watching the team as it marches into the sea.
	\item Often, the death march will involve desperate attempts to right the course of the project by asking team members to work especially grueling hours, weekends, or by attempting to ``throw (enough) bodies at the problem'' with varying results, often causing burnout.

\item Brooks's law is a principle in software development which says that ``adding manpower to a late software project makes it later'': \vspace{-0.3cm}

\item detect {\bf code smells}, and make appropriate corrections promptly
\item avoid ``development hell,'' where the software is stuck in the implementation phrase for a considerably long time; if I am in charge if such a project, should it be shelved?
\item beware of the {\bf software Peter principle}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item The software Peter principle is used in software engineering to describe a dying project which has little by little become too complex to be understood even by its own developers.
	\item It is well known in the industry as a silent killer of projects, and by the time the symptoms arise it is often too late to do anything about it.
	\item Good managers can avoid this disaster by establishing clear coding practices where unnecessarily complicated code and design is avoided.
	\item The Peter Principle is the principle that ``In a Hierarchy, Every Employee Tends to Rise to His Level of Incompetence.''
	\end{enumerate}
\item The Dilbert Principle refers to a 1990s satirical observation by Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams stating that companies tend to systematically promote their least-competent employees to management (generally middle management), in order to limit the amount of damage they're capable of doing: \vspace{-0.2cm}

\item Parkinson's Law of Triviality (also known as the bicycle shed example, and by the expression colour of the bikeshed) is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that organisations give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.
\item Student syndrome refers to the phenomenon that many people will start to fully apply themselves to a task just at the last possible moment before a deadline. This leads to wasting any buffers built into individual task duration estimates.

	\item When the source code is available under an incompatible license.
	\item When the code cannot be adapted to a new target platform.
	\item When the existing code has become too difficult to handle and extend.
	\item When the task of debugging the existing code seems too complicated.
	\item When the programmer finds it difficult to understand the source code.

\item Prefactoring is the application of past experience to the creation of new software systems. Its relationship to its namesake refactoring is that lessons learned from refactoring are part of that experience.
\item for each software I develop/co-develop, consider providing support for encryption/decryption of source files, and other files
\item goals of each software project: \vspace{-0.3cm}

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Note on Using the OpenAccess SDK by Donald Chai}
\label{openaccesssdknotedonaldchai}

A while ago, I needed to use the OpenAccess SDK to write some code to do some physical design. I tried to get the much touted Python wrappers to work, but they were for OA2.1, while I was using OA2.1.1. The OA API changed just enough to foil any attempts at compilation. Since those wrappers were a big monolith of generated code, I figured I'd probably be better off writing my own. \\
\ \\
I chose SWIG over Boost.Python because of the more advanced typemaps. I actually like Boost.Python better, because it avoids shadow classes, but SWIG's typemaps seemed like the right thing for wrapping someone else's code. Not all of the API is wrapped, because I didn't need all of the API. (Finishing it is left as an exercise to the reader.)\\

\item join/create reading groups for reviewing and discussing journal and conference papers related to my research area; e.g., reading groups for VLSI formal verification, SMT/SAT, MPSoC, \& NoC
\item Pat Hanrahan says: ``Future Work section must be earned''.  If you haven't made us care about your contribution thus far, we won't care to read {\tt Future Work} either.
\item analog formal verification: Quo Vadis? --- Where are we going with analog formal verification? What are the research directions for analog formal verification?
\item {\bf When writing journal and conference papers, turn your shortcomings into advantages. For example, ``while it cannot do Task A, it is acknowledged that Task B is more important than Task A. So, it doesn't matter if Task A can be done very well, or done at all.'' }

		\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Find out how do prolific researchers get their manuscripts noticed, reviewed, and approved for publication
		\item Take rejection of your journal/conference paper submission ``at face value.''
		\item Prolific researchers get more papers published, since they are more persistent in trying to get the paper published.
		\item ``If you've got the gut feeling that you've got good stuff, you've just got to be persistent.'' -- Matt Rayner
		\item ``The refereeing process can be haphazard'' -- Mark Hauber
		\item ``The moral of the story is that the publishing process requires not only hard work but also resilience -- and struggling young authors can learn valuable lessons from those who have already navigated that process.''
		\item Quote: In taking the all-important route to publication, inexperienced authors have several factors to consider and obstacles to overcome, from finding ways to combat writer's block to gracefully pursuing the journal-submission and review process. Established authors and journal editors suggest thinking early about the right journal and finding an appropriate editor, the best reviewers and, of course, an appropriate audience of readers. And new authors should be careful to polish their work and respond meticulously and politely to reviewers' comments without getting overwhelmed or frustrated by lengthy, time-consuming queries. Those who follow such advice are more likely to find success. Those who don't could end up on the wrong side of the `publish or perish' divide.
		\item Quote: For many publishing veterans, the writing process starts at the earliest stages of designing a research project. ``Nothing beats a comprehensive, thought-out experiment. Do that up front and your writing will come so much more easily,'' says Mark Blumberg, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City and editor-in-chief of Behavioral Neuroscience. It can be helpful to think of the project as a tentative title for the article it will become, a constant reminder of the scope it should span, recommends Bill Nazaroff, an environmental engineer at the University of California, Berkeley.
		\item Quote: Eileen White, associate director of the Cancer Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick and a senior editor at Cancer Prevention Research, says that researchers should have a ``neat package'' of an interesting question, experiments to test it and a final answer. And a key to winning over editors and reviewers, says White, is having strong data to support conclusions. ``Some people don't appreciate the fact that a lot of weak data does not make up for having less, but more powerful, data,'' she says.
		\item Quote: Before starting to write the paper, authors should carefully choose a journal audience for their research story -- and initially aim for the highest-impact, highest-profile journal possible. ``The submission process is fast enough today; it's worth the effort of sending your paper to the highest journals where it belongs,'' says Hauber.
		\item It is better to have a smaller number of publications of outstanding quality than many decent publications, since recruitment of researchers and tenure-track faculty focuses on high-impact publications.
		\item ``Junior scientists should be thinking about the one paper that they'll place proudly at the top of their CV, job applications and grant proposals.'' -- Mark Hauber
		\item Quote: When should the writing begin? Research presented at a meeting or as a poster is almost certainly far enough along to begin writing up. But some researchers say that it is never too early to start -- students should be writing a little bit every day. Keeping a folder of pertinent literature and beginning with a simple outline of relevant points gleaned from that literature can provide the essential elements of a paper's introduction. Likewise, taking time during field or bench work to write short chunks of the materials and methods used can help to document these activities while they are fresh.
		\item Writers' tips: The key to effective writing: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item You are only as good as your last paper -- previous success does not guarantee future acceptance.
			\item You've got to hook the editor with the abstract.
			\item Don't delete those files. Keep every version. You never know what aspect you can use for some other piece of writing.
			\item Writing is an amazingly long learning curve. Many authors say that they're still getting better as a writer after several decades.
			\item The most significant work is improved by subtraction. Keeping the clutter away allows a central message to be communicated with a broader impact.
			\item Write every day if possible.
			\item Once you've written what you wanted to convey, end it there. K.P.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Look at papers from the same journal to determine their length and organization. Gauge the length of the paper and sections by the number of paragraphs. Determine the number of figures and references in the papers. Break up the ``daunting sections'' ``into more manageable portions''.
		\item To overcome writer's block, start by carrying out the easier tasks of writing first. E.g., contacting a collaborator, ``checking a reference,'' or edit material that was written the previous day.
		\item ``Recognizing that writing is a long process is valuable. Find a mentor in that process, somebody to guide and coach you.'' -- Bill Nazaroff
		\item Be aware of my working patterns, and write when I am most productive. Get myself into the writing zone, and get stuff done.
		\item ``Be clear and concise and use simple language whenever possible.''
		\item ``Important but poorly written papers could end up being sent back unreviewed by busy editors.''
		\item ``Editors stress the importance of clarity above all else, to help convey arguments and logic to them and to readers. They say that most writers make the mistake of assuming too much knowledge on the part of their audience. In reality, even at the most specialized journals, only a handful of readers will be such close colleagues that they don't need any contextual set-up.''
		\item Quote: Editors say that one way to identify holes or gaps in logic that would be vulnerable in peer review is to imagine a skeptical audience reading the manuscript. ``Think of the most adversarial reader you can imagine, and write to substantiate the veracity of your arguments and to anticipate criticisms and answer them,'' says Wojtal. Some editors suggest that `winning over' a skeptical editor, reader or reviewer should be the ultimate goal of any paper's abstract. ``Editors read the abstract and start formulating a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, looking for reasons to rip it apart,'' says White. ``You want them to form a positive point of view from the very beginning,'' she says. Leslie Sage, an astronomy editor at Nature, says authors should avoid an abstract structure that says: we did X, which told us Y, and has implications for Z. Instead, he says, start with why a reader should care about learning more about Z and then explain how this work furthers that goal.
		\item Quote: Likewise, says Nazaroff, the introduction should persuade readers ``that you know what you are talking about and have something new to teach them.'' Wojtal also advises authors to clearly distinguish between data in the results section and inferences about what they mean in the discussion section. This way, even if an editor or reviewer does not agree with a lab's interpretation of the work, he or she may still see the need to publish such an important data set.
		\item Quote: Often, less is more for junior scientists crafting manuscripts. The introduction need not cite every background article gathered, the results section should not archive every piece of data ever collected, and the discussion is not a treatise on the paper's subject. The writer must be selective, choosing only the references, data points and arguments that bolster the particular question at hand.
		\item ``Even polished authors go through an average of 10-12 drafts, and sometimes as many as 30.''
		\item Quote: Writers should ask not only the principal investigator to view drafts, but also every co-author, as well as fellow students or postdocs, and colleagues outside the immediate field of research. Lead authors should give co-authors set deadlines of 10 days to two weeks to suggest changes. Experienced authors counsel letting the draft sit for a few days before reading it with fresh eyes to catch mistakes or problems in flow. Blumberg prefers to read drafts aloud with his students to spot errors.
		\item Quote: When the paper is ready to submit, says Wojtal, the author should devise a cover letter that includes a brief synopsis of the article's argument, and suggestions for a few potential reviewers, as well as those who should be excluded. Such information, he says, can be very helpful to busy editors, who want to know who is familiar with the work and will be easy to reach. Authors should not suggest reviewers who are personal friends or institutional colleagues; including those people could immediately erode the editor's trust. Authors need to find a balance -- it is fine to exclude a couple of reviewers who are direct competitors or known naysayers, but restricting too many qualified reviewers can backfire. ``As an author, your job is to make the editor's job as easy as possible,'' says Blumberg.
		\item Address each comment of the reviewers step-by-step. Work through the lists of comments by the reviewers, ``and explain how the criticisms were addressed, or why they were not, in the resubmission cover letter to the editor.''
		\item ``A clear, succinct resubmission letter may result in an editor making their own decision rather than sending the paper back out for another round of review.''
		\item ``The worst thing an author can do is to ignore a reviewer's criticism and send it back without an explanation.'' -- Steven Wojtal
		\item ``If you strongly believe the reviewers have erred and that the editor should hear from you, definitely send an e-mail ... Be as polite as possible, stick to the facts, and keep it to the point.'' -- Mark Blumberg
		\item ``Young scientists would be wise to embrace written communication as the foundation of an academic career and the key to earning tenure, winning funding and, ultimately, sustaining a research program ... If your result is not published, you haven't done anything ... You might not set out to be an enthusiastic writer, but you should try to learn to love it.'' -- Mark Hauber

\begin{itemize} \itemsep -4pt

\item {\bf Introduction phase of the presentation}
\item Before telling me what you did, tell me why I should care $[$about your research$]$.

%	General advice for giving presentations
\item {\bf General advice for giving presentations}
\item A great speaker could make any topic seem interesting and accessible, and some of the talks I ended up enjoying the most were ones I thought I wouldnÕt even understand!
\item During a presentation on my research, answer the following question, ``How is the big picture divided into subproblems, and where do you fit in?'' Now that the big picture is clear, what are the specific subproblem challenges? Which part of which subproblem are you working on? Some of this will necessarily get into details that not everyone in the audience can follow. If your efforts succeed, what will you have demonstrated? Another way to ask this is: what is the ``research question'' (or questions) being addressed here? In other words, ten years from now, when the hardware, software, etc. have all changed and the computers of the day make today's computers look like Tinkertoys, what fundamental nugget of an idea will still be considered relevant and applicable? This is often very hard to identify, and it may be that your own piece of the project contributes only a small part toward forming that Big Idea...
\item When giving a presentation on my research, take time to explain the motivation of the problem well, and be sure everyone understands (at least at a high level) why it's useful, interesting, etc.  This is time well spent: if people don't understand the ultimate goal, they probably won't pay attention to what you did.

\item do not make too rigid technological assumptions that limit generalizations. It is however important to understand the details ... {\bf The devil is in the details unfortunately}
\item do not make too rigid assumptions to get a broad perspective on the problems that may limit innovation.
\item do not spend undue time in securing industrial uptake of academic research... That is, do not worry about whether if the industry is going to adopt your innovations, algorithms, tools, and methodologies. Pursue good research, and the industry will adapt good technological innovations.
\item be innovative without challenging sound scientific practice or limiting industrial impact
\item determine what the value proposition of your product would be early on -- I need to know this early to earn angel or VC funding
\item create a new market segment with my R\&D effort/investment, rather than join a market segment that is packed/filled with big market players
\item pursue organic growth and development
\item attempt to come up with radical innovations that will generate a positive cash flow soon after implementation
\item be aware of my environment and the business ecosystem that I am in, such as being aware of market consolidation and production consolidation, and things that are getting commoditized
\item {\bf develop a sound plan for ``technology-to-product transition''}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item In business and engineering, new product development (NPD) is the term used to describe the complete process of bringing a new product or service to market. There are two parallel paths involved in the NPD process: one involves the idea generation, product design, and detail engineering; the other involves market research and marketing analysis. 
	\item {\bf continually improve research-to-product transition; start from doing good research to develop radically innovative technologies, and turn such technologies into products}
	\item {\bf having a good research-to-product development flow is an important factor in the success of a start-up}

\item Unique Selling Proposition (also Unique Selling Point)
\item proprietary technology, sustainable advantage, and follow-on products

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Career Advice for Research in EDA}
\label{careeradviceforresearchineda}

Career advice for research in EDA: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -4pt
\item Come up with ideas for a new product/service, develop design plans, prove the concept with a prototype/simulation, pitch it to your managers and senior management (corporate executives/C-Suite); that is, ``get an opportunity to have an idea floated by someone, and try to get funding. That's quite an experience, very broadening'' -- Rico Mariani ... knowing your facts, knowing what's important, knowing what's good for the business, what makes a good business case ... Think of Bill Mullen's (VP @ Synopsys in 2007) experience in getting funding for his power and timing analysis/optimization project; he had developed the prototype, and had three/four members in the team then
\item Prof. Ian Parberry's philosophy for running the Game Development Research Group (GDRG) at University of North Texas (UNT) is given as follows; see \url{http://www.eng.unt.edu/ian/research/philosophy.html}; available May 8, 2010. GDRG values research that is: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Deep, not superficial. GDRG papers will not be hastily-written, shallow, nor destined to obscurity.
	\item Done in small groups, not large anonymous ones. We will be sharing knowledge and understanding with graduate and undergraduate students, not working in large groups where it is hard to assign credit, nor working in isolation.
	\item Tied into the ``web of research,'' not done in a vacuum. We will acknowledge prior related work in full, aiming for a paper that is significant enough to be cited in turn.
	\item Innovative, not repetitive. We will follow new threads, not embroider past achievements.
	\item Well-grounded, not half-baked. We will implement systems, not just describe them. Experimental data generated by these systems will be large enough to achieve statistical significance.
	\item Knowledge, not just data. 
	\end{enumerate}
\item move people's focus/attention from minor problems, which you can solve, to major problems that you are seeking help with or opinions for
\item ask penetrating questions about the product/technology
\item don't be a ``one hit wonder''; the term ``One Hit Wonder'' describes an artist or band who had great popularity with a single song, and who then never reached such popularity again
\item beware of regularly developing one-trick ponies that may cause inconvenience about people; the slang term ``one trick pony'' is used to refer to something that can only be used for one very specific application
\item make a plan for what you do
\item be deliberate about what you do
\item be autonomous, and drive technology
\item {\bf ask, ``How bad can it be?''} ... When you make a mistake, always ask this question. At the worst, move on!
\item have fun with what you do, experiment with your product to see how well it works and determine its failure modes, keep up with current and emerging technologies (even if it is outside of your field), and be creative (try new things to make your product/innovation better)
\item nurture your ideas, and realize them ... ideas are worthless
\item suppose it $[$this job$]$ doesn't work out, you go get another job! -- Jim Gray to Catharine van Ingen
\item when/if you are not having fun, what's the point? -- Catharine van Ingen
\item Edsger Dijkstra's tips for PhD students: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -4pt
	\item Never compete with colleagues
	\item Try the most difficult thing you can do
	\item Choose what is scientifically healthy and relevant. Don't compromise on scientific integrity. 
	\end{itemize}
\item choose work that is challenging and interesting, because it will keep your attention and help you learn ... also, it saves some time playing with good ideas
\item read several sources for a concept (thoroughly), so that I can see different approaches to the material and then synthesize what's most relevant
\item if I cannot obtain a permanent full-time position at an organization I would like to work for, I can take a temporary job or paid internship there, or volunteer there as an unpaid intern
\item when I take up a job, think about acquiring the skills that I will need for the next position that I am aiming for
\item take relevant classes for research, such as research methodology, statistics, technical writing, and management
\item get the $[$inside$]$ scoop, and learn about a prospective department's tenure practices by talking to faculty and students
\item become aware of trends that may affect hiring, such as recession, the emergence of new subfields, and rates of faculty retirement
\item get teaching experience in graduate school, or as a postdoc, before I apply

	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item \url{http://www.edadesignline.com/guest_blogs/217200218}
	\item ``Does the EDA industry have a roadmap?'', in EDA DesignLine (04/27/2009 2:02 PM EDT)
	\item Roadmaps look ahead. For example, the 2001 ITRS told us that power and productivity imperatives would drive the industry to {\bf SOC design methodology convergence} and a {multicore-centric future}, and that {\bf embedded software} and the {\bf design-manufacturing interface} presented looming crises. {\bf The implications of such predictions cannot be addressed by crash programs instituted only after wakeup calls; they demand proactive and sustained attention.}
	\item reduced risk of another type of delivery error, namely, solutions that are plain wrong or mismatched to designer needs
	\item I can say that {\bf there are really only around 6000 EDA R\&D heads worldwide at any time.} This number is at best stable (cf. industry revenues, research funding levels, etc.).
	\item Some of these R\&D resources are inevitably spent on fruitless directions, and are also subject to overlapping efforts (competitors build equivalent technologies, and geography (North America, Asia-Pacific, EU) creates triple-redundancy in funding of research programs)
	\item As the 6000 number includes professors and graduate students, this is clearly not a large resource; it must be as well-targeted as possible.
	\item The wisdom at Intel and many other semiconductor companies is that {\bf around 6-7 years are needed to bring a new EDA technology ``from DAC paper to production flow''}. Again, correct directions must be identified as early as possible. 
	\item $[$the$]$ industry $[$needs to focus on its$]$ priorities, $[$and establish$]$ agreements on non-differentiating (``commodity'') infrastructure and standards, so that these crises can be tackled: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item software and concurrency
		\item analog/RF
		\item die-package-board
		\item die stacking
		\end{enumerate} 
	\item with a fixed number of EDA R\&D engineers, we need to stop working on some issues
	\item In the big picture, who wins a power format or current-source model or process variation model war is less critical to semiconductor industry health than consensus, interoperability, and moving on to fundamental design technology challenges.
	\item EDA roadmaps: \vspace{-0.3cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS): \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item the main EDA roadmap is found in the {\bf Design chapter of the ITRS}, which provides quantified technology needs and potential solutions across system-level, logic- and physical-level, verification, DFT and DFM design technology arenas.
			\item The closely aligned {\bf ITRS System Drivers chapter} roadmaps key product drivers and aligns with the iNEMI (International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative) roadmap
			\end{enumerate}
		\item MEDEA+ EDA roadmap; see \url{http://www.medeaplus.org/index.php}
		\item Japan's STRJ Working Group 1's roadmap for design technology
		\end{enumerate}
	\item $[$build up and align my research portfolio with EDA roadmaps$]$
	\item Questions to ask concerning roadmaps: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item EDA engineers $[$and grad students$]$: ``Do you know your company's $[$or research lab's$]$ roadmap?''
		\item EDA managers $[$and professors$]$: ``How much of your product roadmap and R\&D budget is directed to solving long-term -- i.e., more than 7 years -- design technology needs?''
		\item EDA customers: ``Do you proactively define (at what time horizon), or do you just accept and live with, the roadmaps of your EDA suppliers?''
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Arguably, design technologists today do not have a roadmap -- at least, not in the way that manufacturing technologists do.
	\item Many companies are in the throes of reinventing themselves; nearly all are focused on a 1-quarter horizon and not a 20-quarter horizon. Perhaps those MRMs (management review meetings) with key customers and partners (Intel, TSMC, etc.) are a sufficient roadmapping process for EDA.

	\item ``Risk-reward structures in EDA,'' in EDA DesignLine, May 15, 2009
	\item {\bf The EDA Innovator's Dilemma} -- In the ``innovator's dilemma'' (Christensen, 1997), a market leader competes by adding incremental features to its market-leading product until eventually displaced by a ``disruptive technology'' in one of two ways. : \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item In low-end disruption, the market leader's stream of added features eventually overshoots the market need, opening the door to simpler and lower-cost solutions. The history of Tangent, Avant!, Magma, Silicon Perspective, (Sierra, Atoptech, etc.) in the SP\&R space is a good example of cyclical low-end disruption in EDA... It recalls an old March 2003 quote, ``SOC designers ultimately can't use big Swiss Army knives stuffed with too many back-end EDA technology options,'' and the saying that ``those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it''.
		\item In new-market disruption, a disruptive technology opens up markets that did not previously exist. From the analyst and investor standpoint, a key challenge for the EDA industry is that it doesn't experience nearly enough new-market disruption. 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item {\bf The EDA Innovator's Solution}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item The ``innovator's solution'' (Christensen and Raynor, 2003) is a set of precepts and strategies with respect to market segmentation, leadership, growth, etc., according to which successful companies can identify, develop and unleash the next disruptive technology.
		\item Two key elements of the ``innovator's solution'' are: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item outsourcing of commoditized, ``more than good enough'' solutions
			\item strategic investment in disruption-based growth
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Unfortunately, the EDA industry's outsourcing and investment doesn't match the ``innovator's solution'' model: companies still compete on commodities (back-end data models, power formats, etc.) while outsourcing long-range R\&D
		\item {\bf Why does this fail as an ``innovator's solution''?}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
			\item {\bf First, outsourcing of R\&D is neither sufficient nor stable.}
			\item The ``research funding gap'' mentioned in my last posting is a world-wide insufficiency that is, essentially, a ``tragedy of the commons''. This has occurred despite the efforts of many champions across companies, consortia, and funding agencies who have tried to maintain research investment levels and well-considered project portfolios.
			\item As for stability, the past few years have seen the pools of startup-based ``outsourced EDA R\&D'', as well as EDA research at universities and consortia, dry up as a consequence of macroeconomics and new funding targets (cleantech, biotech, homeland security, etc.).
			\item {\bf Second, long-term success is difficult when one has outsourced the strategic R\&D that gives rise to future disruptive technologies.} 
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Consider the risk-reward structure in an established EDA (or, IC design) company. Technology assets are primarily software (C++ or Verilog), the original developers are long gone, and there is a lot of ``legacy'' in the IP portfolio. This leads to a highly risk-averse profile, i.e., a tendency toward ``don't touch'' and ``leave well enough alone''.
	\item Legacy code -- despite the benefits of seasoning and reuse -- eventually becomes an albatross. Given the incremental product evolution that is inherent in the ``innovator's dilemma'' (recall the path to low-end disruption!), it is no wonder that market leaders can end up far off target with their ``next-generation'' products. 
	\item I would claim that low-end disruption in EDA does not resemble laser mask writers being displaced by e-beam mask writers, or vertically integrated steel mills being replaced by mini-mills. All too often, the periodic event in the EDA world is not the emergence of a new and disruptive technology, but simply a mundane, inertial loss of agility and ability to respond to the market.
	\item Next, consider the risk-reward structure for academic researchers. The first point to understand is that ``risk'' equals ``effort'' (how many researcher-months of salary and benefits and opportunity costs are sunk into a project), and ``reward'' equals ``likelihood that a respectable and impactful publication is the result''.
	\item The classic assumption is that research targets exist along a continuum. At one end, there is low-risk-low-reward research: incremental, turn-the-crank, with some ``minimum publishable unit'' outcome. At the other end, there is high-risk-high-reward research: e.g., trying to prove that P != NP. Depending on personality, talents, career stage, and other factors, academics choose their targets along this continuum. But in EDA research, again we've got it backward.
	\item For EDA researchers today, speculative, far-out research often has low risk but high reward. An example from my past: very few comparisons or proofs of superiority were needed to publish that first paper on physical design of quantum-dot cellular automata based chips.
	\item On the other hand, highly incremental research can require an enormous amount of effort and industry-grade experimental infrastructure to support any claimed contribution.
	\item Again drawing on examples from my past: making the next speed-quality improvement in KL-FM bipartitioning or mixed analytic and partitioning-based global placement are very high-risk research propositions. This anomaly is magnified when reviewer criteria set ``not novel'' as grounds for rejection.
	\item The result: academic researchers constantly pose ``new'' problem formulations (escaping the duty of apples-to-apples comparison with previous works), blurring the leading edge of knowledge and ultimately slowing progress on real problems.
	\item Question: How can EDA researchers regain a risk-reward tradeoff that correctly associates high reward and high impact with high risk?
	\item More than 10 years ago, the MARCO Gigascale Silicon Research Center established the Bookshelf of Fundamental CAD Algorithms (see ``Toward CAD-IP Reuse: A Web Bookshelf of Fundamental Algorithms'', A. E. Caldwell, A. B. Kahng and I. L. Markov, IEEE Design and Test, May-June 2002, and VLSI CAD Bookshelf 2 ). See \url{http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/}
	\item The idea of the Bookshelf was to provide a repository for reusable ``CAD-IP'' -- source codes, benchmark data, evaluation scripts, etc. -- to enable R\&D engineers in both academia and industry to advance the leading edge without having to reinvent the wheel. The food for thought in this posting: Might it be time to revisit some of the ideas that motivated the creation of the Bookshelf?
	\item An EDA company that better manages the ball and chain of legacy code will have greater agility and more resources that can be directed toward new markets and new technologies. This implies that companies must make greater investments in foundations and infrastructures for product and technology innovation. In the context of IC design and EDA, this includes software engineering methodology, software infrastructure, and fundamental algorithms (e.g., repurposable optimization engines, machine learning engines, etc.).
	\item In the EDA research context, the MARCO GSRC Bookshelf promoted open-source publication, along with standardized benchmarking and comparison methodologies. By reducing the overheads of research at the leading edge, such culture changes can effectively reduce the ``research funding gap'' and rebalance risk-reward structures toward research that has impact on core technology challenges.
	\item The past decade has also seen an important addition to the original Bookshelf concept: simplification. When researchers release elegant, compact codes that embody the leading edge in astonishingly few lines of code -- global routers from Michigan, or synthesis packages from Berkeley -- the impact across both academia and industry can be profound. If conference and journal reviewers and funding agencies follow suit, rewarding or incenting simplifications and productivity (speedup) improvements at least on par with 5 percent and ``new problem'' advances, then the world will have changed for the better.

	\item ``Open source EDA software defeats Lock-in --- Dream on,'' in EDA DesignLine Engineering Guest Blog, June 10, 2009
	\item ``You have to distinguish between open source software and open source EDA software. There's a big difference. For open source software, you just need to create an application, but for open source EDA software you also need to have a scientific background, need to understand physical design, and have to have some mathematical algorithms to code. In the case of a synthesis tool, for instance, you have to be able to minimize the gate count while also improving the timing closure. Cadence or Synopsys spend a lot of money on research developing these types of features, a $[$level of resource$]$ completely lacking in the open source EDA community.''
	\item ``The EDA vendor community understands today that interoperability is very important, but this is frequently a weakness in the open source community. Open source EDA developers often try to invent their own file formats. Very few of them use industry standard formats to avoid having to start from scratch. Through FEL $[$Fedora Electronic Lab$]$, we are trying to change that, however, to convince developers to work so they can interchange their data easily. If we can share data between the different applications developed by the open source EDA community and the vendor tools, it will be a way to encourage tool users and designers to use and contribute to the open source tools.''

In analog EDA, the slow road is the way to go.'' -- Henry Chang, in an interview with Richard Goering, in Expert's Corner: ``Analog complexity demands new verification approaches,'' By Richard Goering, 12/19/07; see \url{http://www.scdsource.com/experts.php?id=64&page=1}

\item Have I recently attended any ``eye-opening talks'' related to my research?
\item ``Users are exceptionally good at what they do, completely overloaded in their daily jobs, reluctant to transition away from a known good solution, and realistic about EDA marketing claims. Users donÕt do science projects. They very well understand the realities of bringing up a new tool, they have hard budgets and P\&Ls to deal with, they always have other fish to fry, and they have very conservative profiles when it comes to benefit-cost propositions.'' -- DFM luminary, Prof. Andrew Kahng, \url{http://www.scdsource.com/experts.php?id=178}

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Advice on Choosing an Advisor}
\label{sssec:advicechoosingadvisor}

Advice on choosing an advisor: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Check if the professor/researcher has the following characteristics/attributes: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item {\bf Listen patiently}. Give the student time to get to issues they find sensitive or embarrassing.
	\item {\bf Build a relationship}. Simple joint activities -- walks across campus, informal conversations over coffee, attending a lecture together -- will help to develop rapport. Take cues from the student as to how close they wish this relationship to be.
	\item {\bf Don't abuse your authority}. Don't ask students to do personal work, such as mowing lawns, baby-sitting, and typing.
	\item {\bf Nurture self-sufficiency}. Your goal is not to ``clone'' yourself, but to encourage confidence and independent thinking.
	\item {\bf Establish ``protected time'' together}. Try to minimize interruptions by telephone calls or visitors.
	\item {\bf Share yourself}. Invite students to see what you do, both on and off the job. Tell of your own successes and failures. Let the student see your human side and encourage the student to reciprocate.
	\item {\bf Provide introductions}. Help the student develop a professional network and build a community of mentors.
	\item {\bf Be constructive}. Critical feedback is essential to spur improvement, but do it kindly and temper criticism with praise when deserved.
	\item {\bf Don't be overbearing}. Avoid dictating choices or controlling a student's behavior.
	\item {\bf Find your own mentors}. New advisers, like new students, benefit from guidance by those with more experience.

\item Choose a topic you love: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item This may be the most important criteria
	\item You're going to be spending so much time with this project, and your quality of life will be much better if these hours are spent enjoyably
	\item What's more, the quality of your research, writing, and arguments will be much better if you feel genuine passion for your work
	\item Choose a topic you find both fascinating, and socially $[$intellectually$]$ significant $[$Or, one that may lead to the commercialization of your research as a spin-off or start-up$]$
	\item Never let someone pressure you into writing about a certain topic!
	\end{enumerate}
\item Pick something your advisor finds interesting and is knowledgeable about: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Of course, if this is not possible, you might want to change your advisor instead of changing your topic
	\end{enumerate}
\item Pick a topic that will be helpful in your career path: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item If your goal is an academic career, pick a topic that you can easily modify into journal articles or a book, and that will lend itself well to future research
	\item If you want to work at a teaching oriented institution, consider a topic you can use in the classroom
	\item If you are going into industry, choose a topic that will make you more marketable.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Find a topic that establishes your niche in your field: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Do your research and find a topic that fits into existing bodies of literature, but that builds upon theory and expands it $[$It is easier to do this, rather than to create a new field (of your own)$]$
	\end{enumerate}
\item Choose research that is unique: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Do significant research to make sure this topic has not been done before
	\item Be creative and choose an idea that stands out from the pack as original and innovative 
	\end{enumerate}
\item Think carefully before you choose a controversial topic: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item  Academics are a sensitive lot, and in every field there are certain topics and positions that will send highly educated people into intellectual temper tantrums
	\item This doesn't mean you should avoid topics that push people's buttons
	\item However, if you choose a controversial topic, think carefully about whether it might restrict your employment, tenure, or publishing opportunities
	\end{enumerate}
\item Pick a topic that you already have some expertise about: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item This will help preserve your sanity and get you out the door faster
	\item This isn't the time to explore a brand new area
	\item Along the way, take coursework and write class papers that will help you write your dissertation or thesis
	\end{enumerate}
\item Pick a manageable topic: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item This is a huge project, but it isn't your life's research
	\item A good advisor will help you narrow down your topic so that you don't remain in graduate school for many long years
	\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf When I am considering a dissertation topic, and am investigating a particular technique/technology, ask the following questions:} \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item {\bf What is the value proposition of $[$this technique/technology that I'm considering$]$?}
	\item {\bf Can this technology be leveraged? If so, how?}
	\item {\bf How much can it improve design and verification productivity?}
	\item {\bf Have publications about this technique/technology gained a lot of traction in academia and in industry?}
	\item {\bf While these question should not be used to judge whether it is worth pursuing research in a particular topic, it can help me determine if there are opportunities to develop radical innovations since a considerable amount of research has not been done in this topic. That is, if this research topic is an emerging research topic, whatever ``little'' that I do can be considered significant.}
	\item {\bf I should pursue a research topic because I am passionate about it, and want to know more about it. As such, I want to carry out investigations and run experiments/simulations to determine aspects of it that no one else has, or prove that existing theories, models, or solutions are inadequate and develop better theories, models, or solutions.}
	\item {\bf However, I need not let this research pursuit remain purely an idealistic academic endeavor. Doing good research in my chosen research topic can lead to the creation of start-ups, opportunities of postdoc fellowships with world renowned research scientists and engineers, research positions in industry or nonprofit research institutes, or tenure-track positions in academia!!!}
	\item {\bf For example, with respect to the Ph.D. position at the Uni Trento, ask the following:} \vspace{-0.1cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item {\bf What is the value proposition of SMT-based formal verification?}
		\item {\bf Can this technology be leveraged? If so, how?}
		\item {\bf How much can it improve design and verification productivity?}
		\item {\bf Have research publications on SMT-based formal verification gained a lot of traction in academia and in industry?}
		\end{enumerate}

\item Factors for determining whether a research project is good (from \url{http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/91102-choosing-successful-research/fulltext}): \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item {\bf Are you solving an important problem?} Why can't it be solved using today's technology? How will solving it make the world better?
	\item {\bf Is the market big enough?} In other words, who will benefit from you solving this problem, and by how much? Who will care?
	\item {\bf Is it simple?} The more complex an idea, the harder it is to communicate. If you can't explain it to an executive in one slide, they're unlikely champion your idea. If the product team doesn't understand your implementation, they will never take ownership of it.
	\item {\bf Is it a breakthrough?} What idea or technology do you have that your competitors don't? What prevents the product group from solving this problem on their own using known technology? Does your approach compare favorably to the alternatives, both in product and in the academic literature?
	\item Does this topic fascinate me?
	\item If you don't have a burning question to answers, don't pursue a PhD.

Advice for initial research on chosen topic: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Planning phase: Spend about three months on the literature survey. I should continue to regularly read research publications on this topic for at least the first year, so that I can be ready to take my qualifying examination. For each research publication that I read, enter its {\sc Bib}\TeX\ database, summary, and paraphrase key points into my {\tt BibDesk} database.
\item Last viewed on June 6, 2010. See \url{http://www.dcsc.tudelft.nl/Education/Graduation%20Guide0910.pdf}.
\item Questions that I can ask concerning my approach to solve a research problem (or answer a research question): \vspace{-0.3cm}

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Advice for Comps/Prelims and Quals}
\label{adviceforcompsprelimsandquals}

Advice for Ph.D. comprehensive examination (or comprehensive exam/comps), Ph.D. preliminary examination (prelims), and Ph.D. qualifying exam (quals): \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item it may consist of three written exams and an oral examination, only written examinations, or only oral examinations --- Check with the department
\item {\it \bf Are comps the same as the general examination (or generals)?}
\item comps/prelims are used to establish that the student is qualified to embark on Ph.D.-level research in the chosen field
\item quals are used to make sure that the student has a good plan for finishing the Ph.D., and that the committee (especially the advisor) and the student agree on the scope of the future research
\item study strategically and organize citations
\item keep up with class readings for seminar classes, which are classes that typically involve reading lots of papers and writing literature reviews (survey papers)
\item review my study notes for my classes, and formulate my ideas
\item read strategically: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item while some departments disseminate a suggested reading list to graduate students, many require students to create their own
	\item students who write their own reading list, which typically includes journal articles and review papers, should make sure to organize it by topic and have a professor review it
	\item students can more readily synthesize and recall information if they read journal articles in a logical order, organized chronologically and by topic
	\item use a good reference management software, such as {\tt BibDesk}, to facilitate the organization of research publications that I have read 
	\end{enumerate}
\item keep abreast of my field: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item professors often get ideas for questions from reading the latest research and controversies
	\item when studying for the exams, graduate students should take time to peruse the latest journals in their field
	\end{enumerate}
\item take detailed notes: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item after reading an article, write down the main points of the article
	\item summarizing the research publication forces me to think critically as I read and the summaries provide material to study later
	\item { \bf Aim to read $>$100 papers, while writing my qualifying exam research proposal}
	\item make sure that I try to find the importance of every paper that I read
	\end{enumerate}
\item get organized: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item spend time before quals using a good reference management software (e.g., {\tt BibDesk}) to get my research publications in order; { \bf I should continue to keep my research publications in order, as long as I am doing research}
	\item use {\tt BibDesk}, or other good reference management software (also, citation management software or citation software), to keep track of where I store digital copies of research publications on my computer ... By using keywords and/or the name of the author(s), I should be able to search for a research publication, and access its digital copy (if any) ... While I can tag each B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ entry in a B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ file, where I store all my references, I would still have to use Finder\texttrademark, and perhaps Spotlight\texttrademark, to find the digital copy (if any) of the research publication ... With a good reference management software, such as {\tt BibDesk}, I can use the keywords to access the B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ entry and the digital copy (if any) of the research publication
	\item use {\tt BibDesk}, or other good reference management software, to keep summaries and notes of research publications that I have read ... Again, I can enter such summaries and notes of research publications as comments after each B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ entry in a B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ file; however, I would have to take extra steps to locate the B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ entry and the digital copy (if any) of the research publication, and I may have trouble locating the B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ entry and the file ... With a good reference management software, such as {\tt BibDesk}, I can use the keywords to access the B{\scriptsize IB}\TeX\ entry, and my notes and summary for the research publication, as well as the digital copy (if any) of the research publication
	\item { \bf I should only use ONE reference management software for any significant period of time; else, I would lose some of the benefits of managing the references and their storage (digital copies of references)} --- I would otherwise need to keep porting my repository of research publications between reference management software
	\item create an index of research publications, which is organized by topic and author
	\item know where all my research publications are (don't scatter them around); use BibDesk to search for and keep track of research publications, and my corresponding notes and summaries for them
	\item make an itemized report of what information (my summaries and notes of publications) I have
	\end{enumerate}
\item seek advice from older students: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item students who have already passed their comprehensive exams make great resources
	\item don't shy away from asking them (advanced Ph.D. students/candidates) for advice, or even for copies of their graded research proposals
	\item some colleges keep copies of past qualifying exams; { \bf if I need to take written and/or oral exam(s), try and see if I can get a copy of such past qualifying exams from the department's administrators for revision}
	\end{enumerate}
\item ask questions: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item when you receive your exam questions, and if you are not sure what any question is asking, seek the faculty for clarification; else, I may end up taking a wrong guess about what the question is asking for, and give the wrong answer
	\item do not feel that I am admitting ignorance if I ask a question; the question can be expressed better
	\item it is better to risk looking uninformed than to give the wrong answer to a question (especially an answer that is off-topic)
	\end{enumerate}
\item read the directions: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item under pressure, even normally meticulous students might fail to notice formatting details
	\item test-takers should note the number of pages (or marks, as a percentage) allotted to a question, and the formatting requirements of the comprehensive exam
	\item double check that I have answered every part of each (essay) question
	\end{enumerate}
\item be thorough, not encyclopedic: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item { \bf packing in too many citations is an all too common mistake}
	\item I can spend a lot of $[${ \bf unnecessary}$]$ time in the library or on the Internet, finding every article remotely relevant to the question ... { \bf Don't do that and waste my time; remember what Alicia Lowery told me about ``researching everything under the sun before I finish my thesis''}
	\item I need to be aware of the major trends, but I don't have to write an anthology
	\item while the intensive preparation can be exhausting, it pays
	\item I may not get any of those curveball questions; don't worry about such questions
	\item at the end of the $[$oral exam of the$]$ quals, elicit feedback from the professors $[$and research scientists$]$ on my thesis committee about my professional development; this can be validating in terms of the hard work that I have put in, and my research direction
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Notes about the Depth Exam Style}
\label{depthstylequestionsforcompsprelims}

Notes about the depth exam style:\\
This would have more emphasis on the broad context of the assigned papers than solely on the specific details of the individual papers, although demonstrated understanding of the assigned papers would still be critical. It would be expected to include much more about papers relevant to the area but not necessarily directly related to the assigned papers. There would tend to be somewhat less emphasis on recapitulating the specific techniques of the assigned papers but more on their context and on the general techniques used within the area as a whole. It would be expected to include discussion of avenues and methods that might be fruitful for future research in the context of the whole range of research in the area. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Writing a Ph.D. Thesis}
\label{writingaphdthesis}

Notes on writing a Ph.D. Thesis: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item {\it The contribution to knowledge of a Master's thesis can be in the nature of an incremental improvement in an area of knowledge, or the application of known techniques in a new area. The Ph.D. must be a substantial and innovative contribution to knowledge.}
\item Take at least one complete term for writing the thesis, so that I have sufficient time to organize my arguments and results
\item As I formalize my results into a well-organized thesis document, check if my thesis is capable of withstanding the scrutiny of expert examiners. Have I discovered any weaknesses in my thesis? How do I fix these weaknesses? Have I fixed these weaknesses? 
\item Spell difficult new concepts out clearly
\item Choose section titles and wordings to give the examiners clear directions to information they are seeking for in my thesis. Make it easy for my examiners to easily determine my problem statement, my defence of the problem, my answer to the problem, and my conclusions and contributions. Doing these can reduce the need for major revisions, and the number of minor revisions I have to make for my Ph.D. thesis.
\item Remember that a thesis is not a story: it usually doesn't follow the chronology of things that you tried. It's a formal document designed to answer only a few major questions such as: {\tt What is this studentÕs research question? Is it a good question? (Has it been answered\\ before? Is it a useful question to work on?) Did the student convince me that\\ the question was adequately answered? Has the student made an adequate\\ contribution to knowledge? } 
\item Avoid using phrases like ``Clearly, this is the case...'' or ``Obviously, it follows that ...''; these imply that, if the readers don't understand, then they must be stupid. They might not have understood because you explained it poorly. 
\item Avoid red flags, claims (like ``software is the most important part of a computer system'') that are really only your personal opinion and not substantiated by the literature or the solution you have presented. Examiners like to pick on sentences like that and ask questions like, ``Can you demonstrate that software is the most important part of a computer system?'' 
\item The purpose of your thesis is to clearly document an original contribution to knowledge. You may develop computer programs, prototypes, or other tools as a means of proving your points, but remember, the thesis is not about the tool, it is about the contribution to knowledge. Tools such as computer programs are fine and useful products, but you can't get an advanced degree just for the tool. You must use the tool to demonstrate that you have made an original contribution to knowledge; e.g., through its use, or ideas it embodies.
\item the dissertation can be viewed as a teaching exercise, in which I learn how to conduct, design, and analyze independent research.
\item commit 10 to 20 hours per week for 12 to 18 months to avoid becoming a casualty to the ``All But Dissertation (ABD)'' label
\item set specific work hours and choose a specific place to work
\item communicates my expectations and needs on topics such as deadlines, meeting frequency, authorship credit, and work hours ... For example, if I crave more praise or regular feedback than my advisor dishes out, I can confront the problem directly, such as by saying, ``I am getting discouraged: Tell me three things I am doing right here''
\item beware of these: procrastination, a tendency toward perfectionism, conflicts with advisers, lack of communication with dissertation committees, and failure to finish the dissertation
\item do not push aside unstructured tasks, such as the dissertation, in favor of more immediate tasks ... manage time well for these unstructured tasks
\item advice on how to reach the finish line: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
	\item set priorities and goals: set daily, monthly, and yearly goals
	\item pick a timeline and stick to it
	\item know what you're getting into
	\item choose a manageable dissertation topic
	\item establish a network within the program
	\item be assertive and set boundaries when needed
	\item relax and have the right attitude
	\end{enumerate}
\item find a ``study-buddy'' to work with ... that way, I would be committed to working on my dissertation for myself and my ``study-buddy''
\item Introduction of a thesis: ``the first part of my thesis lays the groundwork necessary to carry out similar investigations in directions not considered by Cremona'' ... ``In part two of my thesis, I use the well-developed theory of modular forms, combined with the algorithms of part one, to investigate two outstanding conjectures.''

				\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
				\item Reader: Filing a thesis is a degree requirement, but really it is written for a reader. Be considerate to this reader, {\bf giving him all the information he needs to appreciate and build on your work}. At the same time be concise as the reader probably is in a hurry - just like you.
				\item Scope: Focus on your contributions, not the field at large. Many theses contain a very large tutorial component, while the actual work is only touched on. There is no set length for a good thesis, but 5 pages are usually not sufficient to clearly describe your work, and 50 or more pages of introductory material will deter most readers.
				\item Completeness: {\bf Give all information needed to recreate your work}. Often only the general design procedure and perhaps a textbook equation are included, but actual data is missing. {\bf Your contribution is not only finding the equation, but also applying it, so document the entire process.}
				\item Conclusion: {\bf Draw conclusions from your results, explain why something is important (or not), and rank considerations in order of importance. This applies to every topic, chapter, and the complete thesis. Be careful, though, not to extend your conclusions too far and state limitations. Your solution may be the best in a particular situation but not necessarily always.}
				\item Language: Incorrect language makes the most interesting thesis unreadable. Run the spell checker and proofread everything.
				\item Format: Neatness counts É again since this improves readability. But do not waste your time with unnecessary frills of modern word-processors.

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Advice for Ph.D. Oral Defense}
\label{adviceforphdoraldefense}

Advice for the Ph.D. oral exam, oral defense (German: verteidigung/kolloquium), viva voce (/viva), or dissertation defense (/thesis defense) -- how to present a successful dissertation defense: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Note that a shorter version of the oral defense can be included in a ``job talk'' (usually an hour-long lecture) that I would give during an interview for an academic position, except that the ``job talk'' would involve a presentation of my work to date as well as my future research plans ... The job talk shall not focus on the minutia of my past research, while leaving out the larger context of my work. Show attendees of the talk, professors and students (grad students and undergrads) that I have a vision, and I don't have to just stick to one study, or even my own work... Allow my personality to come through
\item don't worry about hardball questions
\item learn what's expected, anticipate the hard-hitting questions, open myself to feedback and, most importantly, remember to relax
\item enjoy myself in the Ph.D. oral defense ... Because it's not every day that I have a roomful of scholars completely interested in what I have to say -- it's something special I should enjoy
\item learn the rules and norms for a defense delivery for the department (or, specifically the Ph.D. program) that I am in ... determine my department's expectations by talking with my dissertation chair or fellow students: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Am I expected to bring refreshments, or is that practice discouraged?
	\item Are I allowed to invite friends and family members, or is the defense open only to other graduate students or faculty?
	\item Should my presentation be 10 minutes or 30?
	\item Should I hand a final copy of my dissertation to my committee a month in advance, or is two weeks the norm?
	\item Usually, refreshments are not a requirement and defenses are open, but don't assume that's the norm for my department
	\item students are usually expected to book the room and date for their defense, which can take time ... Give myself a month to do that. It can be challenging to find a time when five busy faculty can meet
	\end{enumerate}
\item communicate with my committee members: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item talk regularly with my thesis committee about how my research is going
	\item my thesis committee can range from four to five members, depending on the program, who I hand-picked when I began the dissertation process
	\item consult them if I need to alter my methodology or circulate drafts, and to gather advance input if possible
	\item be open to the perspectives of the committee members ... but don't be shy about sharing my expertise or defending a point of view
	\item get as much feedback as time permits in both written commentary and in-person meetings with committee members ... It's a chance for them to ask the tough questions ahead of time
	\item document my progress by having committee members sign off on any major revisions they request at the proposal stage ... Taking that step can prevent confusion among faculty at the defense meeting about why dramatic changes were made
	\item don't go off on my own; if I do, I may fail my Ph.D. oral defense
	\item do what I agreed to do in my proposal, and communicate with my committee about changes
	\item contact with my committee can provide some valuable insight into the types of questions they might ask during the defense -- as can doing a little advance detective work
	\item know my committee members' likes, dislikes, and pet peeves
	\item ask people who have been through a defense with them, read their articles, and surf the Web for more information on their research expertise and specialty areas
	\end{enumerate}
\item practice and prepare: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item be prepared to present a clear explanation of why I did the study, a brief overview of my methodology and results, and a discussion of the implications of my research, but don't recite the manuscript
	\item the assumption is that my committee has already read my dissertation in detail ... I don't want to bore them by going through it again; I just want to refresh them
	\item at the same time, don't assume that my committee members have memorized my manuscript
	\item if they ask a question that I think I addressed, don't assume they remember that I addressed it; repeat myself patiently
	\item for the question-and-answer portion that follows the presentation, students should be primed to answer questions about their methodology, to defend and explain their choice of analysis, and discuss how their study contributes to the literature, informs theory and where the research might go next
	\item staging a mock defense with fellow graduate students is a great way to practice answering the types of questions I may be asked
	\item join a student-research group that regularly organizes practice defenses
	\item in some cases, the dry run will be more challenging than the defense; sometimes, students ask harder questions than faculty
	\item many students say attending another student's defense helps them prepare and know what to expect
	\item pick a well-prepared peer, since attending a defense that doesn't go well can be anxiety-provoking instead of helpful
	\item practice my talk in the room where I'll eventually defend
	\item know where I will move, look, sit, and take notes
	\item the less I have to react to in the moment, the more focused I can be on the task at hand, which is to demonstrate I have strong knowledge of my project
	\end{enumerate}
\item develop the right attitude: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item approaching the defense as a critically constructive experience is key
	\item avoid coming off as too protective about my work during the meeting, but to also not be overly compliant about committee members' feedback
	\item students should be open to the perspectives of the committee members, who are committed to helping improve their dissertation, but they shouldn't be shy about sharing their expertise or defending a point of view if they feel their committee may be misinformed
	\item what's more, students shouldn't feel discouraged if their committee asks for minor revisions to their manuscript after the defense
	\item it's not at all uncommon for committee members to suggest a different analysis, some changes in a table, or to rework the discussion section to clarify a certain point ... students sometimes have a couple days work ahead of them to put it in final shape
	\end{enumerate}
\item breathe, then answer: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item stumped by a question? ... Don't be afraid to take a moment to consider it, paraphrase it back for clarification or ask that it be restated
	\item similarly, if I don't know the answer, it's better to say so and give the best answer I can, rather than digressing for a few minutes
	\item keep in mind that for the most part faculty are just asking questions to see if I can think critically -- they are not trying to be difficult or stump me
	\item staying calm can be one of your greatest assets during the defense
	\item it's normal to be anxious and scared about my defense, but many people before me have passed, and I can too
	\end{enumerate}
\item stage a mock dissertation defense with fellow students to practice answering questions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Advice for Applying for Postdoc Positions}
\label{adviceforpostdocapplications}

Advice for securing postdoc positions, and achieving postdoc success: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item start my applications early ($\geq$1 year before expected date of Ph.D. oral defense)
\item Set goals: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Before I begin my search, decide what I want to get out of the experience
	\item Do I want to learn new skills?
	\item Acquire in-depth training in an area of expertise?
	\item Get great mentoring?
	\item Look ahead to what I think I want to be doing, and work backwards from there
	\end{enumerate}
\item Do your homework: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Thoroughly investigate potential positions
	\item Will the position fit with the goals I've set?
	\item Will I get the mentoring and training I need?
	\item Are there health benefits?
	\item Have others been happy there?
	\item Talk with former postdocs and other psychologists to find out
	\end{enumerate}
\item Don't give up: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item even if it seems too late in the year, keep applying and networking
	\item new funding or postdocs who backed out of a position could open up opportunities
	\end{enumerate}
\item Think ahead: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -3pt
	\item Once I'm in a position, keep my next steps in mind
	\item Where is my first ``regular'' job going to come from?
	\item If I don't get a job right away, what will I do?: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item engage in open research independently, and with others
		\item publish lots of papers ... publish, publish, publish!!!
		\item engage in open source software development
		\item engage in open source IC design
		\item advice students on their honors (senior capstone) and Masters projects
		\item Where do I want to go after my postdoc?
		\item What happens if that excellent but elusive job isn't available?
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item Find a career mentor: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Link myself with a mentor who can help me through the job search
	\item a mentor can be an early-career/seasoned professor or research scientist
	\item Someone who can honestly discuss what job opportunities look like, what the appropriate things to ask for, and say, and do are
	\end{enumerate}
\item Spell out my expectations: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Discuss my duties and goals with my supervisors before I take the position
	\item Some even advise writing up a contract that includes what the supervision will entail, what skills or training I'm going to get from the fellowship, and how much autonomy will I get in my research projects ... This is helpful for organizations without an established training program for postdocs; get our goals and expectations articulated ... Beware of make-it-up as I go positions
	\end{enumerate}
\item Check my progress: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item once I start my supervision, regularly discuss my progress toward my goals with my supervisor
	\item write down my fellowship goals at the beginning of the year, and constantly referred back to them to stay on track during my postdoc program(s) ... Determine if I have the flexibility to alter them
	\item ask the right questions, and be proactive about it
	\item seek and earn more degrees of freedom to try to get some additional training
	\end{enumerate}
\item regard pursuing a postdoc research fellowship as taking that step toward what I really want to be doing as an independent investigator; it may take more than one postdoc to make that transition
\item Mentor fit: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item think about the qualities of my Ph.D. advisor that are good for me and that help me work well, and look for those qualities in a postdoctoral mentor
	\item research gets done better and more quickly when I really click with the person I'm working with
	\item Has the researcher provided good mentoring to other fellows?
	\item Have fellows published papers with the mentor?
	\item What was the authorship order of those papers?
	\item Talk with current and former postdocs, interns, and staff to get a feel for how things work
	\item think about it as I am hiring this mentor to work for me ... do the vetting of the prospective mentor before I start talking to him/her about writing a grant together
	\item consider whether the mentor will allow me the level of independence I need ... if I am transitioning to a new research area, I'm not ready for complete independence; however, when I'm ready to work autonomously, I need to work in a lab that gives me the freedom that I need ... In this case, a different lab may be a better fit
	\item Get a postdoctoral advisor who is willing to bat for me to overcome bureaucracy.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Funding: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item How will my research be funded?
	\item If I'll be on a grant, how long will the grant last? Is that enough time to complete my work?
	\item I may need to begin applying for the next year's funding shortly after I begin my fellowship.
	\item Two common funding approaches are to get written into an investigator's research grant or, to show I am competitive with others, to write my own research grant $[$such as those for NSF/SRC in the US$]$
	\end{enumerate}
\item Goals and expectations: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Talk over my fellowship objectives with my mentor and seek agreement, perhaps writing a contract that seals it.
	\item Once in my fellowship, continually evaluate my progress based on those goals
	\item However, that doesn't mean my objectives can't shift
	\item fellowships often represent the last time I have such freedom to explore my various research interests as a researcher
	\item In terms of my intellectual development, nothing beats it
	\item I don't have faculty meetings, don't have to teach. I can just focus on my research.
	\end{enumerate}

	\end{enumerate}
\item Nature Publishing Group (a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited): \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Kendall Powell, ``Careers and Recruitment: A foot in the door,'' in {\it Nature}, Vol. 463, No. 7281, pp. 696-697, February 4, 2010. Available online at: \url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nj7281-696a}; last accessed on December 31, 2010. \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item I should commence looking for a postdoctoral research position early in my penultimate year.
		\item When looking for a postdoctoral research position, I shall take note of the name of research labs which journal/conference papers that I find are interesting. That is, each time I read an interesting journal/conference paper, take note of the name of the research labs and its affiliation (name of department, and organization/university).
		\item Compile a list of 20-30 research labs that I find are interesting. Pare down this list to about 5-6 labs, which I will apply to. Use the same heuristics for applying to graduate school. These 5-6 research labs shall include: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item A reach lab, which I want to be part of but may have difficulty securing a postdoctoral research position in
			\item 3-4 match/target labs, which postdocs and Ph.D. students are comparable to me in terms of research excellence, and which I shall have a good chance of securing a postdoctoral research position in
			\item 1-2 reliable/safety labs, which I should be able to secure a postdoctoral research position in
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Network with students at those labs in conferences, workshops, symposiums, and other events (such as ``summer schools''). Network with the principal/primary investigators (PIs) too!
		\item Make notes/summaries of poster presentations and talks from researchers in these labs.
		\item Make notes/summaries of their conference and journal papers. Try to get access to Ph.D. theses from their labs, and read them too. Pay special attention to the ``Future Work'' sections of the Ph.D. theses and conference papers.
		\item To secure a good postdoctoral research position, I must carry out ``diligent background research aimed to answer the question, `{\bf What do I want to get out of my postdoc?}'.''
		\item The question, ``What do I want to get out of my postdoc?,'' is analogous to the question for prospective Ph.D. students, ``What do I want to get out of my Ph.D. program?''
		\item ``Although they are short-term assignments, postdoc positions should be viewed as stepping stones to a longer-term independent career -- whether in academia, industry or another science-related post.''
		\item ``For that reason, it is hard to overstate the importance of the postdoc application. It is the fledgling scientist's bid to get noticed -- to gain a phone or in-person interview with labs. Background research, a carefully crafted curriculum vitae (CV) and cover letter, and personalization of each application will open doors. Form letters and typos will get applicants nowhere.''
		\item ``I wanted to apply to proven, top-notch labs where I was going to have the success and track record of the people coming out of these labs'' -- Toby Franks
		\item {\bf WARNING: Note that some postdoc positions require applications 12-18 months in advance.}
		\item Treat the process of applying for postdoctoral research positions like applying for R\&D jobs in the EDA/semiconductor industry. Apply to several positions simultaneously, so that I can interview in person with potential employers and lab colleagues prior to making my decision (about which offer of a postdoctoral research position to accept).
		\item ``An application typically consists of a cover letter introducing the applicant and his or her reasons for joining this particular lab; a CV outlining education, publication record, honors and accomplishments; and three referees who will provide supportive letters of recommendation on request. Some students also include a research summary of their graduate work; others incorporate this into their cover letter.''
		\item ``A little preparation goes a long way at this stage. Consider taking a workshop on writing cover letters and CVs, have senior colleagues review them, and proofread them carefully.''
		\item The cover letter and CV shall be free of mistakes.
		\item Things that PIs look for when hiring postdocs: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item First-author conference and journal publications, which prove that I ``can complete a project from start to finish'' as a junior scientist.
			\item Given the size of my home institution and resources available to my Ph.D. research lab, what have I accomplished? PIs want to see if Ph.D. students can accomplish a significant amount of things, despite the constraints in resources.
			\item List experiences that illustrate non-research responsibilities, including sitting on grad school or department committees, or hosting seminar speakers.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item ``Applicants should highlight what they hope to accomplish in general in a postdoc position. Specific details of projects should be left for the interview.''
		\item Quoted: Agneta Nordenskj{\"{o}}ld, a genetics researcher at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, advises spelling out your contributions to a graduate research project. ``Write it in a way that says, `I did this' or `My part of the project was', especially if you did something outstanding,'' she says.
		\item ``Those applying after taking a break from science must work harder to convince a lab head. Kristofor Langlais had been teaching high-school science at a ski academy in Vermont when he applied for postdoc positions in the Washington DC area.''
		\item ``After extensive research into each lab's publications, websites and even annual reports, he wrote his cover letters from the angle of someone already in the lab. He mentioned specific results he found interesting and the next natural steps the lab might take. ``I tried to make it sound like I could walk in that day and be self-sufficient immediately.'' He spent 20 hours or more on each application and his strategy paid off -- he had four phone interviews, and ended up in a molecular-genetics fellowship at the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland.''
		\item Quoted: Likewise, when Xiaoli Du was finishing up her doctorate at Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, she knew she would need to send applications to 30-40 labs if she wanted to obtain a postdoc in the United States. But she avoided the form-letter strategy. `` `Dear Professor' does not show respect or that you are really interested in their lab,'' she says. Instead, she personalized each application and stated how her training and experience would distinguish her from other applicants. Her hard work led to a postdoc at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Du suggests attending international meetings to make first contact with potential advisers.
		\item Quoted: Few things, though, confer more of an advantage than secured funding. ``If a postdoc has their own fellowship, they can write their application to me in crayon and I'll take them,'' says Phil Baran, an organic chemist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Unfunded applicants should assure the lab head that they have checked on specific fellowship possibilities and outline a plan to apply for them.
		\item Quoted: There are some definite `wrong ways' to apply. Goldstein, whose e-mail inbox is so overloaded that his system sends an automated response to direct queries to assistants and lab managers, says there is no room for red flags in the competitive arena. Avoid telling personal-life woes, bad-mouthing previous labs or advisers or expressing a desire to work at night so that you can surf during the day. Explain gaps in a CV or publication record.
		\item Quoted: ``Anything that signals the person is a prima donna, no matter how great they are, I don't go for,'' says Ken Yamada, laboratory chief at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research in Bethesda, Maryland. ``Research requires teamwork.''
		\item Quoted: Lab heads want a clear indication that applicants have carefully thought through their career goals and chosen this lab as the appropriate stepping stone. ``Does a genuine passion, drive, and hunger for research come through in their letters or on the phone?'' asks Yamada. ``Would they be doing the same thing if they were suddenly independently wealthy?''
		\item Postdoc application to-do list: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Send your application by e-mail or overnight delivery. Consider a paper packet if you have unpublished manuscripts you want to include.
			\item Make it easy for lab heads to contact you by e-mail or phone.
			\item Follow-up by e-mail in 1-2 weeks to make sure they received your application. Don't phone.
			\item Choose referees who really know you, such as collaborators, unofficial advisers or others beyond the standard committee members.
			\item Meet with your referees to explain your career goals to them.
			\item Encourage referees to send their letters promptly (Salk Institute cell biologist Martin Hetzer says that the speed with which a letter lands in his inbox is usually much more telling than the letter's content).
			\item Prepare for the possibility of phone interviews, which may be scheduled or spontaneous. Make sure the conversation is two-way and ask your own questions, too. Have a list of bullet points handy in case you get nervous.

		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Check out how much mentoring is being provided to postdoctoral researchers (postdocs) by principal investigators (PIs).
		\item Check if the postdoc position allow me time to learn and seek guidance.
		\item Choose a research lab to do my postdoc, so that I can have a ``meaningful experience,'' obtain ``strong [research] results,'' and would be able to get ``a desirable job'' based on my postdoc research. Avoid research labs that don't allow me to satisfy these preferences.
		\item ``Good mentoring is an acquired skill.''
		\item Find out if the PI: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Is aware of ``the stages in developing a mentoring relationship''
			\item Coaches students and postdocs, rather than supervises them
			\item ``Build[s] trust with prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}}s and postdocs' expectations''
			\item Replicates the style of mentoring to all her/his mentees. Mentoring should be individualized/customized, since each person is a unique individual and differences exist between cultures, genders, and generations.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item Find out if the institution/university penalizes postdocs who have their own funding or fellowships (including competitive awards). The institution/university may provide medical insurance and other benefits to postdocs who are funded by research grants; hence, they are treated as staff members. If postdocs have their own funding or fellowships, they may not be eligible for medical insurance and other benefits that are provided by the university.
		\item Find out if support is given to non-US residents with regards to applying for non-immigrant J-1 visas or equivalent, relocation to the university's community, and assimilation into the university's community.

					\item There are significant differences in the incomes of researchers between academia and industry in the U.S. and in Europe.
					\item Academics in Northern and Central Europe tend to make more than those in Southern Europe.
					\item Academics in the U.S. still dominate in terms of wages and benefits.
					\item There are less differences between the salaries of men and women in Southern Europe than the rest of Europe and the U.S..

					\item Being a tenured/tenure-track professor involves spending about 20\% of my time on teaching, 10\% of my time on administrative activities, and the rest of my time (70\%) on research.
					\item Being a tenured/tenure-track or teaching professor involves: curricular design; and dealing with students from a broad spectrum of cultures and abilities (including students with disabilities and behavioral problems) -- undergraduates tend to start college in their late teens, and many of them are not sufficiently matured.
					\item The time spend on research would involve: managing a research lab; hiring students (undergraduates and grad students), postdocs, and technicians; and applying for funding.
					\item Two stages of getting tenure: 1) find a research topic/problem to work on, plan my research projects, broaden my social network of researchers so that I can collaborate with them or allow some members of the review committee for funding applications to get to know me, and be a co-instructor for graduate classes (\& possibly, lead the discussions/tutorials) and teach undergraduate classes; 2) write and submit research grant applications, \& start teaching classes as the primary instructor.
					\item Try to finish writing research papers based on my postdoctoral research projects prior to becoming a professor, so that I can start writing research grants based on my publications.
					\item Take note that my start-up fund as a junior professor may be low (say tens of thousands of dollars/Euro). This may prevent me from doing much research, unless only a small capital is needed to get my research started.
					\item When writing my grant proposal, specify and explain what would make my proposed technique stand out from the others.
					\item Give talks, including those in department seminars.

Notes about Higher Education in Europe: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item When I look at higher education programs in Europe, note the amount of ECTS credits for each class that I can, or have to, take. Determine if I am chalking up enough ECTS credits to fulfill the requirements of the educational program, and of the Bologna process.
\item The purpose of the {\bf  Bologna process} (or Bologna accords) is to create the European higher education area by making academic degree standards and quality assurance standards more comparable and compatible throughout Europe, in particular under the Lisbon Recognition Convention. $[$This means that if I obtain a degree in a European university, which abides by the Bologna process, that degree can be recognized anywhere in Europe that also abides by the Bologna process. And, if I were to study abroad, the Bologna process makes it easier to get my credits/classes recognized in my home institution, and get them counted towards graduation for my academic program$]$
\item {\bf  European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)} is a standard for comparing the study attainment and performance of students of higher education across the European Union and other collaborating European countries.
\item The {\bf  ECTS grading scale} is a grading system defined in the ECTS framework by the European Commission.

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Landmark Contributions by Students}
\label{sssec:outstandingstudents}

Landmark contributions by students: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Bill Bonvillian, Susan Graham, Anita Jones, Ed Lazowska, Pat Lincoln, Fred Schneider, and Victor Zue, ``Landmark Contributions by Students in Computer Science,'' Version 11, Computing Community Consortium blog, Computing Community Consortium, Computing Research Association, Washington, D.C., September 15, 2009. Available online at: \url{http://www.cra.org/ccc/docs/Student_Achievements.pdf}; last accessed on August 18, 2012. \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Use of Boolean logic to model digital circuits: Claude Shannon at MIT. Shannon is better known for inventing information theory, but this work, his MIT Masters thesis, was a landmark. (1937)
	\item Huffman coding: David Huffman at MIT. Huffman was a Ph.D. student when he invented Huffman coding as a term paper project in a course taught by Robert M. Fano. (1951)
	\item Mathematical foundation of packet communication: Len Kleinrock at MIT. Kleinrock's Ph.D. dissertation, Message Delay in Communication Nets with Storage, established a crucial foundation for the ARPANET revolution, in which he played a central role. (1962)
	\item Interactive computer graphics: Ivan Sutherland at MIT. Sutherland's Sketchpad system -- his Ph.D. work -- laid the groundwork for several decades of advances in computer graphics. Ed Catmull's 1974 Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by Sutherland at the University of Utah, was another landmark contribution to the field, as was John Warnock's 16-page 1969 University of Utah Ph.D. attacking the hidden surface problem. (1963)
	\item Computer vision: Larry Roberts at MIT. Larry Roberts is best known for his role in the ARPANET effort, but his 1963 MIT Ph.D. dissertation, Machine Perception of Three-Dimensional Solids, laid out the entire process for computer vision as we know it today. (1963)
	\item Symbolic mathematics: William A. Martin and Joel Moses at MIT. Martin's 1967 Ph.D. dissertation on symbolic algebra and Moses's 1967 Ph.D. dissertation on symbolic integration launched the MACSYMA project at MIT, the predecessor of todayÕs ubiquitous Mathematica. (1967)
	\item The FLEX language and machine: Alan Kay at the University of Utah. Kay's Ph.D. dissertation, The Reactive Engine, defined the FLEX language, the first extensible dynamic graphical interactive object-oriented language, and the direct antecedent of Kay's Smalltalk work at Xerox PARC. It also defined the FLEX machine, a desktop computer with a fully general display and a multiple clipping window user interface, the inspiration for Kay's Dynabook. Kay says ``Most of us regarded what we were doing at PARC as `phase two' of what we'd already started in graduate school.'' (1969)
	\item The Boyer-Moore theorem prover: Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore at the University of Edinburgh. Moore was a Ph.D. student and Boyer was a postdoctoral research associate. (1971)
	\item Efficient graph planarity testing using depth-first search: Bob Tarjan at Stanford. Tarjan's thesis marked a crucial advance in the depth and elegance of the analysis of data structures for basic computational problems. (1972)
	\item Ethernet: Bob Metcalfe at Harvard. The engineering was done at Xerox PARC, but the invention and analysis of binary exponential backoff as an alternative to the fixed-backoff (and thus unstable) Aloha Network scheme was Metcalfe's Ph.D. dissertation. (1973)
	\item BSD Unix: Bill Joy at Berkeley, working with Bob Fabry and Domenico Ferrari. (1977)
	\item VisiCalc: Bob Frankston and Dan Bricklin at MIT. The spreadsheet -- the ``killer app'' for personal computing -- was invented by Frankston and Bricklin while students at MIT LCS, and sold through the company they formed, Software Arts. (1979)
	\item Public key cryptography: Ralph Merkle at Berkeley and Stanford, along with Martin
Hellman and Whitfield Diffie. Merkle's 1977 Berkeley Masters thesis and 1979 Stanford Ph.D. dissertation made fundamental contributions. Hellman maintains that the ``Diffie-Hellman'' key exchange protocol should be called ``Diffie-Hellman-Merkle.'' Public key certificates, as used ubiquitously in HTTPS-based web sites, were introduced in the 1978 MIT Bachelors thesis of Loren Kohnfelder, advised by Len Adleman of RSA fame. (1979)
	\item The Sun workstation: Andy Bechtolsheim at Stanford, working with Forest Baskett. (1982)
	\item The Connection Machine: Danny Hillis at MIT. Hillis co-founded the Thinking Machines Corporation while an MIT AI Lab Ph.D. student. (1983)
	\item Sphinx (large-vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous speech recognition): Kai-Fu Lee at Carnegie Mellon. While speech recognition has a long history both before and after Lee's work, his Sphinx system, the subject of his Ph.D. dissertation, was a landmark. (1988)
	\item Linux: Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki. Torvalds was a second-year computer science student at the University of Helsinki when he launched the Linux open source operating system project, inspired by Andy Tanenbaum's MINIX operating system and Richard Stallman's GNU project. (1991)
	\item BDD-based symbolic model checking: Ken McMillan at Carnegie Mellon, working with Ed Clarke. Symbolic Model Checking (the title of McMillan's Ph.D. dissertation) has transformed hardware and software verification. (1992)
	\item Mosaic: Mark Andreessen at the University of Illinois. Andreessen invented the revolutionary graphical Web browser while an undergraduate at the University of Illinois working at the National Center for Supercomputer Applications. He subsequently founded Netscape Communications. Microsoft licensed Mosaic from UIUC as the foundation for Internet Explorer. (1994)
	\item The PCP theorem: Sanjeev Arora at UC Berkeley. The PCP theorem (Probabilistically Checkable Proofs) is the cornerstone of the theory of computational hardness of approximation. (1994)
	\item Google: Larry Page and Sergey Brin at Stanford. The Page Rank algorithm is central to Google's success. (Note that many earlier web search innovations were also due to students; for example, Brian Pinkerton at the University of Washington invented WebCrawler in 1994, the first successful full-text web search engine.) (1998)
	\item Akamai (content delivery networks): Danny Lewin at MIT, working with Tom Leighton. (1999)
	\item Peer-to-peer file sharing: Shawn Fanning at Northeastern University. Fanning was an undergraduate at Northeastern University when he wrote the code for Napster, inventing the concept of peer-to-peer file sharing, which has many important legal uses in addition to the questionable ones enabled by Napster. (1999)
	\item The foundations of rocketry and astronautics: Hermann Oberth at G{\"{o}}ttingen. Oberth's Ph.D. dissertation, Die Rakete zu den Planetenr{\"{a}}umen (``By Rocket into Planetary Space''), was rejected by the faculty of G{\"{o}}ttingen as ``utopian.'' Along with Tsiolkovsky and Goddard, he became one of the three (independent) founding fathers of rocketry and astronautics, the foundation of which was described in his dissertation. (1922)
	\item The discovery of the double helix: James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge University. Crick was a Ph.D. student and Watson a postdoctoral fellow at the time of their landmark discovery. (1953)
	\item The Josephson effect: Brian Josephson at Cambridge University. Josephson was a Ph.D. student in Physics when he discovered the Josephson effect (superconductivity), for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1973, at the age of 33. (1962)
	\item Fullerenes: Jim Heath, working with Robert Curl, Harold Kroto, and Richard Smalley at Rice University. Heath was the Chemistry Ph.D. student who conducted the experiments that generated the first C60 molecules and, ultimately, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the three senior members of the collaboration. (1985)

\subsection{\hspace{0.1in} Grad School Information}
\label{gradschinfo}

Things for me to look into when considering graduate and professional programs: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Is the graduate or professional program accredited?
\item Would attending the graduate/professional program help me obtain my career goals?
\item Find out what are the statistics regarding completion rates and time-to-degree duration for the academic program. E.g., on average, how long does it take for a student to graduate? What is the proportion of students who graduate within the expected time-to-degree period (e.g., 4 years for a Ph.D. program)? See \url{http://www.princeton.edu/gradschool/facts/time_to_degree/engineering/} and \url{http://gradschool.princeton.edu/facts/time_to_degree/naturalsciences/} for statistics of graduates from various programs at Princeton University.
\item Some statistics that you may wanna look into include for assessing the department (or at least, the academic program): \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Average number of Ph.D. students per Ph.D. advisor (tells you about advisor-to-advisee ratios)
	\item Number of Ph.D. graduates for the Ph.D. program per year: tells you about the size of the department, in terms of number of faculty members and graduate students (number of admitted students each year)
	\item Graduate outcomes: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item What did alumni do after their Ph.D. programs?
		\item How long did they take to find a job?
		\item If they switched fields, or even professions, 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Drop-out rate\dots\ What is the proportion of students who graduate within the expected time-to-degree period (e.g., 4 years for a Ph.D. program)?
	\item Average duration for time-to-degree\dots\ On average, how long does it take for a student to graduate?
	\item Failure rate for Ph.D. preliminary and qualifying examinations
	\item Median time taken to pass Ph.D. preliminary examinations
	\item Median time taken to pass Ph.D. qualifying examinations
	\item Reasons for dropping out of the Ph.D. program
	\end{enumerate}
\item Some research labs do list the names of alumni members (Ph.D. and Masters students, undergraduates, and postdocs). They may also include their first vocation after their Ph.D. program, and what are they currently doing. You can use this to help you gauge the strengths/weaknesses of the lab/advisor\dots\ Determine if a high proportion of Ph.D. alumni members have switched fields.
\item Assessing the research lab: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Determine if there are publications from this research lab that are considered seminal papers.
	\item Determine if the research lab is doing, or has recently been involved in, transformative research: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Publications that led to the creation of a new research subtopic, and possibly a new research topic (or even a new research area).
		\item Publications describing experimental results on publicly accessible benchmarks that indicate its superiority (e.g., a SAT solver that is 10-100X better than other existing SAT solvers)
		\item Publications 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Determine if the research is interdisciplinary
	\item Determine if the research goals matches with mine
	\item Determine the diversity of the research lab
	\item Interact with lab members to determine if they are inclusive
	\item Determine the quality of the lab members: undergrads, grad students, postdocs, and other research staff. Examine their academic background, publication record, and work/research experience (including internships).
	\item Assess the economic impact of their research. Look at their technology transfer output: examine their patent portfolio, and determine the number of industrial collaborators and number of start-ups or university spin-offs that arise from its research.
	\item Determine if there is a collaborative culture of excellence in the research lab. Do student lab members have a strong desire and will to work really, really hard? Do they take risks: to create new solutions for their class assignments/projects so that they can earn extra credit; to try new things -- such as a new VLSI design flow, or learn a new EDA tool or HDL/programming language; or to create ``commercializable'' IC designs and EDA software)? Basically, are they really, really smart and ridiculously hardworking engineers, who subscribe to a compelling (for some of my engineering homies) and repulsive/odd (for most people, including engineers) subculture that is the stuff of legends?: \vspace{-0.2cm}

			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item Determine if the professor encourages students to turn class projects into mini-research projects, which lead to conference papers or participation in research-based programming contests.
\item Does the department offer classes in research areas/topics that I can and want to take? Remember that some advance classes for grad students are offered only in a few universities, where students will be challenged with class projects, class assignments, and examinations (midterms and finals). Preferably, consider programs that have 3-8 classes in my research area. Else, I would have to learn that stuff (or at least the background knowledge) on your own. It can be hard to learn things on my own, especially if I do not know how to learn independently to a sufficient extent (especially with respect to knowledge relevant to that area/topic).
\item Does the academic program require/allow me to take a set of graduate classes spanning the breadth of the departments's academic field? If so, determine if I can do well in such classes. Do I have several options regarding these requirements?
\item Find out about the culture and subcultures of the on-campus community, student body (student culture is prominent in the U.S.). Your lifestyle choices and preferences would probably be a major factor in helping you decide where to go. You wanna ski or wind surf regularly? Find a campus near the mountains or the sea. Do you wanna golf or hike regularly? Do you need to hit the clubs/bars and party regularly? Do you need to shop regularly to destress? These will help you determine if you wanna stay in a big city, a small city, or a college town\dots\ Underrepresented minorities and GLBT members find it hard in many campuses around the world. Here, try to find information regarding the diversity and inclusiveness of the student body (i.e., campus diversity). Note that a diverse body does not guarantee that the campus is inclusive. It may have students from a wide range of economic and cultural backgrounds, but students may (strongly) prefer to socialize in self-segregated enclaves; see student self-segregation (or auto-segregation)\dots\ Facebook groups/pages (and those on comparable social media outlets) reflect aspects of the student culture, beyond the universities' web pages (including those for student organizations). ``College Confidential'' or equivalent can offer your some interesting tidbits or gossip that may expose things about the campus, including systemic failures of the universities (e.g., to address racism or sexual assault on campus), poor teaching, or poor administrative support.
\item Does the university have a good student support service staff? Does it provide good student support for international students? Are adequate support services provided to help me apply for the visa, relocate and settle down (e.g., help you find an accommodation or at least temporary lodging, create a bank account, and what not)?\item Accommodation options. Is it hard to find decent and affordable housing in the surrounding area? Is housing in the surrounding area cheap? What are some of the statistics of the local population? How diverse is the community? LA Times has some statistics of local populations in LA. You can determine the average income, highest level of education, political views, and so on\dots\ Try to determine if there is an equivalent of that for the local area\dots\ In addition, noisy neighbors and terrible roommates can ruin your semester. Unfortunately, many universities do not provide enough decent and affordable housing options.
\item Financial cost of enrolling in the academic program
\item Preferences of dependent family members and/or significant other
\item Weather and physical environment\dots\ Some people with asthma may wanna avoid certain places with hay fever or very cold weather. People with disabilities may find it hard to navigate certain terrains or campuses/cities/towns.
\item Availability of food sources that are needed to meet strict dietary restrictions, if any\dots\ E.g., Kosher or Halah food requirements, food allergies, or vegan diets and their variants) or disabilities.
\item Availability of certain long-term support services. If you have a need for long-term counseling support or medical consultation (e.g., medical checkups for a chronic/recurrent medical problem), you need to determine if such services can be accessed at affordable costs.
\item Ease of access\dots\ Some cities/towns are hard to reach\dots\ It may take you hours to get to the nearest airport, which may be very small. Traveling to research conferences, job interviews, or getaway places (for vacations) could be painful experiences.
\item Is the university's administration associated with any systemic failure or controversial decisions? For example, some senior university administrators would raise tuition fees so that they can dramatically increase their salaries; the growth rate of their salaries (and hence, the tuition fees) would rise (much) faster than the nation's economic inflation rate. In addition, the university's administration make expand the university's campus or create new satellite campuses at a rate greater/faster than the university's sustainable rate. This can cause financial problems for the university, which may lead to the destruction of research programs and schools/departments (e.g., engineering school at Tulane University and the computer science department at the University of Florida) \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item E.g., Moody's Global Credit Research, which is part of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (New York, NY), published a forward-looking report (in April 2013) about the U.S. higher education industry's financial problems: ``Industry Outlook: US Higher Education Outlook Negative in 2013.'' This report indicates problems with the ``business models'' of ``market-leading, research-driven colleges and universities.'' Their ``diversified revenue streams'' are not generating adequate ``revenue growth.'' For ``long-term financial sustainability'' and to maintain/improve their abilities to ``fund future initiatives,'' they need to ``lower their cost structures.'' They face ``prolonged muted revenue growth.'' With the exception of world-class/elite universities, colleges and ``universities face diminished student demand and increased price sensitivity.'' Hence, they cannot keep raising tuition fees to raise revenue.  Also, ``all non-tuition revenue sources are also strained.'' That is, a number of colleges and universities are ``on a borrowing spree'' and are ``struggling to stay afloat'' financially. Most people do not care about the credit ratings (or bond ratings) of colleges and universities.

		\item Will outdated buildings be renovated?
		\item Will more part-time instructors replace retiring professors?
		\item Will classes get bigger or will students end up in partly online courses?
		\item Will the school even be in business by the time your child graduates in four years?
		\item Many colleges and universities face multi-faceted challenges due to ``technological, demographic and economic'' trends. Is this university one of those universities? Try to obtain a publicly accessible financial statement of the research university, and use it to find out about the financial health of the university.
		\end{enumerate}

\item Macro trends\dots\ Thing of local, regional, and global trends in economics, technology, and what not. Also, pay attention to local (e.g., city-/town-level), regional (at the state/provincial/territorial level or the continental level, such as the EU), and national policies (i.e., public policies). For example, many public universities in California (i.e., the University of California and California State University systems) had to force faculty and staff to take leave, and cut many classes in various campuses due to budget restrictions in recent years due to California's financial problems and the global financial crisis. Nobody wants to get messed up by politicians and policymakers.
\item Can I transfer credit from prior graduate-level classes?
\item Can I place out of intermediate classes, typically taken by underclassmen and junior grad students.

	\item On campus tours, science and engineering schools love to show off their high-tech equipment and promote how many graduates work for Google. But donÕt expect them to mention how tough they grade or how many students wash out. To cut through the hype, here are questions to ask each school to gauge where you have the best chance of succeeding: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item What percentage of science and engineering students stick with those majors through graduation?
		\item What is the average grade for students in my major, and are there limits on how many can receive AÕs and BÕs?
		\item How large are the freshman lectures? How much tutoring do you provide for students who need help to keep up?
		\item And besides the superstars, how many undergraduates really get to help professors with research?

For your degree you have a choice of hundreds of courses offered by the department, the college, and the university. You need to start looking at your options now to ensure that you follow the program that best fits you and your goals. Some of your choices may have profound impact on your career opportunities for years to come.''
			\item ``Learning happens not only in the classroom. The department offers a wide range of options to learn about the field, including undergraduate research opportunities and internships. Many of these are in high demand and often require appropriate preparation (e.g. taking specific courses ahead of time). Becoming an undergraduate teaching assistant is an excellent opportunity to deepen your understanding in core areas of engineering. The EECS Honors degree program gives additional flexibility in your program and the opportunity to select an academic concentration outside EECS.''

These contests are very complex technically, the number of competent teams is small (around 5-6 at ISPD, maybe double that at SAT). Organization quality varies widely. Some past winners and runners up mostly reimplemented known algorithms and were not able to convincingly explain (in their follow-up publications) what innovations they came up with. In some cases, the claimed innovations were downplayed in later publications from the same group. At ISPD, just a few weeks after the contest, the best results are often improved. In some years, several teams were caught cheating. At the SAT contest, there are many complaints about scoring. So, I would look at the combination of contest entries and subsequent publications.} Reference: Igor Markov, Response to my comment on his answer to ``Does a good profile in competition programming help in getting admission in top MS/Phd program at top US universities for Algorithms/Theoretical CS/Systems?'', in {\it Does a good profile in competition programming help in getting admission in top MS/Phd program at top US universities for Algorithms/Theoretical CS/Systems?}, Quora, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, August 4, 2012.

			\item ``As you probably already know, computer science classes are often much more rigorous and time-consuming than the average class at Stanford. With this in mind it is important to properly balance your quarterly class load so that you do not overextend yourself. As a general guideline, having two computer science classes in a given quarter will keep you pretty busy but won't crush you with an inordinate amount of work. Taking three computer science classes in one quarter is generally considered difficult and will probably not leave much room for extra-curricular activities. To even consider taking four computer science classes in one quarter is strongly discouraged. Let's face it, you need some time for eating, showering, and sleeping. To sum things up, see which of these attitudes best fits your lifestyle.''
			\item See Table \ref{tab:csclassloadattitude}.
			\item ``In all seriousness, overextending oneself can have far-reaching consequences as the quarter progresses. Typically, students who take more classes than they can handle end up doing poorly in all of their classes and may be forced to drop a class anyway. This is not meant to discourage anyone from being ambitious when planning a class schedule (there are students who have successfully taken four or more computer science classes in a given quarter), but be prepared for the amount of work required.''

				\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
				\item Getting the most out of the relationship with your research advisor or boss: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item {\bf Meet regularly} - you should insist on meeting once a week or at least every other week because it gives you motivation to make regular progress and it keeps your advisor aware of your work.
					\item {\bf Prepare for your meetings} - come to each meeting with: List of topics to discuss; Plan for what you hope to get out of the meeting; Summary of you have done since your last meeting; List of any upcoming deadlines; \& Notes from your previous meeting
					\item {\bf Email him/her a brief summary of EVERY meeting} - this helps avoid misunderstandings and provides a great record of your research progress. Include (where applicable): Time and plan for next meeting; New summary of what you think you are doing; To do list for yourself; To do list for your advisor; List of related work to read; List of major topics discussed; List of what you agreed on; \& List of advice that you may not follow
					\item {\bf Show your advisor the results of your work as soon as possible} - this will help your advisor understand your research and identify potential points of conflict early in the process. Summaries of related work. Anything you write about your research. Experimental results.
					\item {\bf Communicate clearly} - if you disagree with your advisor, state your objections or concerns clearly and calmly. If you feel something about your relationship is not working well, discuss it with him or her. Whenever possible, suggest steps they could take to address your concerns.
					\item {\bf Take the initiative} - you do not need to clear every activity with your advisor. He/she has a lot of work to do too. You must be responsible for your own research ideas and progress.
					\end{itemize}
				\item Getting the most out of what you read: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item {\bf Be organized}. Keep an electronic bibliography with notes \& pointers to the paper files. Keep and file all the papers you have read or skimmed.
					\item {\bf Be efficient} - only read what you need to. Start by reading only the conclusion, scanning figures \& tables, and looking at their references. Read the other sections only if the paper seems relevant or you think it may help you get a different perspective. Skip the sections that you already understand (often the background and motivation sections).
					\item {\bf Take notes on every paper you find worth reading} - What problem are they trying to solve? What is their approach? How is it different from other approaches?
					\item {\bf Summarize what you have read on each topic} -- after you have read several papers covering some topic, note the: key problems; various formulations of the problem they are addressing; relationship among the various approaches; and alternative approaches
					\item {\bf Read Ph.D. theses} -- even though they are long they can be very helpful in quickly learning about what has been done is some field. Especially focus on: Background sections; Method sections; and Your advisor's thesis (this will give you an idea for what he/she expects from you).
					\end{itemize}
				\item Making continual progress on your research: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item {\bf Keep a journal of your ideas} - write down everything you are thinking about even if you think it is stupid. It will help you keep track of your progress and keep you from going in circles. Do not plan to share it with anyone, so you can write freely.
					\item {\bf Set some reasonable goals with deadlines}: Identify key tasks that need to be completed; Set a reasonable date for completing them (on the order of weeks or months); Share this with your advisor or enlist your advisors help in creating the goals and deadlines; and Set some deadlines that you must keep (e.g., volunteer to give a student seminar on your research, work toward a conference paper submission deadline, etc.)
					\item {\bf Keep a to do list} - Checking off things on a to do list can feel very rewarding when you are working on a long-term project. List the small tasks that can be done in about an hour. Pick at least one that has to be completed each day.
					\item {\bf Continually update your: Problem statement}, Goals, Approach (or a list of possible approaches); One-minute version of your research (aka the elevator ride summary); and Five-minute version of your research
					\item {\bf Discuss your research with anyone who will listen} - use your fellow students, friends, family, etc. to practice discussing your research on various levels. They may have useful insights or you may find that verbalizing your ideas clarifies them for yourself.
					\item {\bf Write about your work}. Early stage: Write short idea papers and share them with your advisor and colleagues. Intermediate stage: Find workshops and conferences for submitting preliminary results. This can also help you set deadlines. Advanced stage: Target relevant journals.
					\item {\bf Avoid distractions} - it is easy to ignore your research in favor of more structured tasks such as taking classes, teaching classes, organizing student activities, creating web pages like this, etc. Minimize these kinds of activities or commitments.
					\item {\bf Confront your fears and weaknesses}: If you are afraid of public speaking, volunteer to give lots of talks. If you are afraid your ideas are stupid, discuss them with someone. If you are afraid of writing, write something about your research every day. One-minute version of your research (aka the elevator ride summary). Five-minute version of your research. List of advice that you may not follow.
					\item {\bf Balance reading, thinking, writing and hacking} - often research needs to be an iterative process across all of those tasks.
					\item {\bf Finding a thesis topic or formulating a research plan}. Pick something you find interesting - if you work on something solely because your advisor wants you to, it will be difficult to stay motivated ... Pick something your advisor finds interesting - if your advisor doesn't find it interesting he/she is unlikely to devote much time to your research. He/she will be even more motivated to help you if your project is on their critical path (although this has down sides too! )... Pick something the research community will find interesting - if you want to make yourself marketable... Make sure it addresses a real problem. Remember that your topic will evolve as you work on it. Pick something that is narrow enough that it can be done in a reasonable time frame. Have realistic expectations (i.e. Don't expect the Nobel Prize ). Don't worry that you will be stuck in this area for the rest of your career. It is very likely that you will be doing very different research after you graduate.
					\end{itemize}
				\item Characteristics to look for in a good advisor, mentor, boss, or committee member: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item It is unreasonable to expect one person to have all of the qualities you desire. You should choose thesis committee members who are strong in the areas where your advisor is weak.
					\item {\bf Willing to meet with you regularly (about 1 hour every week or every other week). You can trust him/her to}: Give you credit for the work you do; Defend your work when you are not around; Tell you when your work is or is not good enough; Help you graduate in a reasonable time frame; and Look out for you professionally and personally
					\item {\bf Is interested in your topic. Has good personal and communication skills}: You can talk freely and easily about research ideas; Tells you when you are doing something stupid; Patient, Never feels threatened by your capabilities; Helps motivate you and keep you unstuck
					\end{itemize}
				\item {\bf Has good technical skills}. Can provide constructive criticism of papers you write or talks you give. Knows if what you are doing is good enough for a good thesis. Can help you figure out what you are not doing well; Can help you improve your skills; Can suggest related articles to read or people to talk to; Can tell you or help you discover if what you are doing has already been done; Can help you set and obtain reasonable goals. Will be around until you finish. Is well respected in his/her field. Has good connections for the type of job you would want when you graduate; Willing and able to provide financial and computing support.
				\item {\bf Avoiding the research blues}: \vspace{-0.1cm}
					\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
					\item When you meet your goals, reward yourself.
					\item Don't compare yourself to senior researchers who have many more years of work and publications.
					\item Don't be afraid to leave part of your research problem for future work.
					\item Exercise.
					\item Use the student counseling services
					\item Occasionally, do something fun without feeling guilty!

			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt
			\item Do not expect people to tell me how to solve certain problems, especially implementation details as a researcher.
			\item Learn to find out for myself what I need to know. That is, determine the scope of things that I need to know, the time frame and deadline(s) in which I should acquire knowledge of those skills and knowledge, and create a plan to acquire those skills and knowledge.
			\item I should learn to be more resourceful, and determine where can I get help. Particularly, resources (e.g., publications and online material), individuals, and networks of people that can provide a significant amount of help to people.
			\item Make a serious effort to solve a problem before I approach others for help. Else, they may get annoyed when I did not bother to learn how to solve problems that are actually very simple. Also, bring my (attempted/considered) solutions to the people who I seek help from. Show them my flow charts, schematics, calculations, algorithms, and heuristics. This would convince them that I have done my homework, and am not asking bane questions.
			\item To help me understand how to apply the skills and knowledge that I am acquiring in ``practical, real-world applications,'' I should look at textbooks (including alternative textbooks/books, such as handbooks and encyclopedias) for such examples. I can also look ahead further in the chapter, book, or books of subsequent classes to see how these skills and knowledge will be applied. Note that information that I skip while reading my textbook, manuals, and guides may actually contain the solution that I am looking for. Think of the questions that I asked Anders Franzen about the SMT-LIB manual during my internship at FBK while working on the {\it MathSAT} project. I did not understand the material in the manual, since I lacked a background in compiler design and formal grammar/languages. So, I had to get he to help me interpret what I was reading. This was like when I was learning about UNIX as a freshman/sophomore. I did not understand what I was reading when I looked at the UNIX manual (``man pages''). Thus, I shall learn how to read technical literature better.
			\item By reading technical and semi-technical magazines and newspapers/newsletters, I can learn about ``practical, real-world applications'' of the things that I am learning about. In addition, by talking to others (students further ahead of me in engineering education and professional engineers), I learn to see how can I apply the things that I am learning about in ``practical, real-world applications''. Furthermore, I can tap into the newsletters and technical magazines of professional organizations, such as ACM and IEEE, to find out about research opportunities/projects where I can apply what I am learning about.
			\item If my lecture slides/notes and textbooks(s) do not have adequate worked-out examples (e.g., only trivial examples) to help me understand mathematical theories and formulas, and engineering concepts, I shall seek other resources. E.g., I can look at lecture slides/notes from equivalent/similar classes that are taught at other universities. In addition, I can look at other textbooks/books on this subject. Note that for advanced topics, such as those covered by advanced graduate classes, I may only be able to find 1 or 2 books on this topic. So, I may not always have the luxury of looking at worked examples from other textbooks; e.g., I could find many textbooks for differential equations and vector analysis, but not for antenna analysis or satisfiability modulo theories.
			\item I shall improve my ability to work out problems on my own if I cannot find adequate examples for that problem or similar problems. In addition, I shall document worked solutions digitally, so that I can refer to them during revision for an exam, my prelims/quals, or when I encounter a similar problem during research and development.
			\item I shall also improve the way I revise/relearn concepts, technologies, skills, and knowledge. Documenting resources and prior solutions to problems would help me relearn things. Such documentation requires proper information management, so that I can reuse the previously acquired knowledge and skills. Remember that using \LaTeX\ on a UNIX-like operating system helps me with information management.
			\item If I do not understand how and why things work, determine if knowledge of that is required for solving problems in my research/class project, or assignment. If not, I can move on and address this when I have more free time (e.g., ``slack'' periods during the calendar year). To find out more about how certain things work, I can look into the references in my lecture slides/notes and textbooks(s), or search/google for references online. Note that learning how and why certain things work may require (advanced) knowledge that is outside the scope of my discipline or research area. Hence, it is important to know when to stop delving into (/investigating/probing) a concept/technique. Remember my problems with understanding Prof. Sanjit A. SeshiaÕs publications on adaptive eager encodings, in which he used ``polyhedral theory'' (I believe in the context of integer programming and combinatorial optimization) to prove a theorem regarding the satisfiability of UTVPI formulas? Ditto for lambda expressions (and lambda calculus) so that I can understand how syntax is represented for
	a given signature in first-order logic.]
			\item I shall improve my ability to convert descriptions of architectures and techniques into hardware/software implementations. It is easier to grasp the concepts in pseudocode, flowcharts, schematics, figures, and demonstrations than to learn the concepts from text and create abstractions of those concepts on my own. I shall improve my ability to create pseudocode, flowcharts, schematics, figures, and demonstrations from what I have read, especially in journal and conference papers.
			\item I shall improve my ability to perform statistical analysis on my experimental data, and analyze the figures/graphs that I have plotted.
			\item Use a book from the {\it Schaum's Outline} series from {\it McGraw-Hill} to help me learn material from introductory and intermediate classes. ``Even if you can't find a reference with exactly the type of coverage that works best for you, just reading about the same topic in two different places usually clarifies the ideas.'' [Remember how I read about the same topic in different advance engineering math textbooks to learn concepts for my classes in differential equations and vector analysis?]
			\item Working with others allows me to overcome obstacles that I may not be able to overcome on my own. While I may give up on learning certain things or overcome specific problems in individual projects, my teammates may be able to come up with solutions to problems in group projects. In addition, working in a diverse group exposes me to solutions that can be more effective and/or efficient... {\it students routinely teach one another in group work -- and as any professor will tell you, teaching something is probably the most effective way to learn it.}
			\item Try to find groups of three to four people to work on a problem. When I work in pairs, I may not expose myself to a sufficient variety of approaches. Similarly, when I work in larger groups (i.e., $> 4$), some individuals may be left out of the ``active problem-solving process''.
			\item I shall endeavor to outline solution on my own first, without being boggled or encumbered by the implementation details. Subsequently, I can work out the complete solutions with my group. If each individual does this, each group member can learn how to get started in solving problems in the project. That is, let's outline solutions to the problem, before we meet to discuss our considered solutions and develop the complete solution together.
			\item ``For group work to be fully effective, every group member should be able to explain in detail every solution obtained in a work session. Having the group members (particularly the weaker ones) go through these explanations before ending the session is a good way to make sure that the session has achieved its objectives.'' This will mitigate the tendency for the more technically challenged and reserved individuals to accept proposed solutions without understanding those solutions.

Is this an undecidable problem? If not, it is decidable. Then, is it intractable (or NP-complete)? If so, reduce it to 3-SAT. Else, this problem should be reasonably doable.

I suppose you mean parallel formal verification. This is our long-term topic and I expect to continue working in this area.
3 topics in parallel formal verification
The first is about using graphical cards to speed-up formal verification, 
the other one is on formal verification of specific micro-controllers ... Our colleagues here develop software for specific processors. We hope the size of the state space is much smaller than in general software, hence amenable to brute force verification.
implementing (parts of) verification tool on programmable hardware --- implement part of a formal
verification algorithm/tool in an FPGA

Does your research lab only seek software or hardware solutions to formal verification using parallel computing?
Typically yes, we also explore using hard-disks. This is where is our expertise

breakdown of my VLSI formal verification research in SMT solvers, and categories of case studies (datapath + control module + memory module + interconnect network) 
datapath + control module + memory module + interconnect network (on-chip busses, mesh interconnect structures, NoCs) + I/O circuitry Rabaey03, pp. 379-380
Rabaey03, pp. 439 high-level synthesis = behavioral synthesis = architecture synthesis

The correctness of a system can be explored by scanning all possible executions using symbolic representations of the state space. However this method will not scale up with the size and complexity of the system. Furthermore, though model checking can find potential bugs, it can not provide proofs of correctness.

%A match school is one where your academic credentials fall well within (or even exceed) the schoolÕs range for the average freshman.  There are no guarantees, but itÕs not unreasonable to be accepted to several of your match schools.
%A reach school is one where your academic credentials fall below the schoolÕs range for the average freshman.  Reach schools are long-shots, but they should still be possible. If you have a 2.0 GPA, Harvard is not a reach schoolÑitÕs a dream.

%Word-Level Format Verification via SMT Solving
%The research activity will aim at investigating and developing novel techniques, methodologies and support tools for Satisfiability Module Theories (SMT) for the verification of WORD-level circuit designs, with particular attention to the development of efficient SMT solvers for word-level reasoning. This work will be part of the "Word-Level Formal Verification via SMT Solving" (WOLFLING) project, a three-year custom research project supported by SRC/GRC (http://grc.src.org/fr/S200802_Call.asp), in strict collaboration with the Formal Verification Group at Intel, Haifa.

%Let the hiring manager set the conversational tone.
%Cohen's version of rule No. 2, "don't talk to a man first." In an interview follow the hiring manager's lead. Let him or her set the tone. But if you sit down and an awkward silence ensues, break the ice by saying something like, "It's great to be here, thank you so much for spending time with me." While you don't want to dominate the conversation, you do want to appear socially skilled.
