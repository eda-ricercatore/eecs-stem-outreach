# eecs-stem-outreach


Resources for outreach and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including electrical/computer engineering and computer science (EECS).

It includes information about scholarships and fellowships for studying at
	institutions of higher education (i.e., colleges and universities), including
	studying abroad.
	
It includes other resources for broadening participation of women and people
	from underrepresented groups (including disabled people).
